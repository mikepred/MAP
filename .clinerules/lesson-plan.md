# Lesson Plan: Python for Text Processing - A Foundation for LLMs

**Project Goal:** Write a Python script that reads a text file, cleans it, tokenizes it, counts word frequencies, displays the most common words, and is structured with functions.

**Target Audience:** Adventurous learners familiar with Python basics (variables, loops, basic data structures, writing simple functions) but looking to apply these skills to a practical project and understand foundational text processing techniques.

**Overall Learning Objective:** To build a functional text processing pipeline in Python and understand how each component (reading, cleaning, tokenizing, counting) contributes to analyzing text data, drawing parallels to the initial stages of data preparation for LLMs.

**Reference to `llms-from-scratch`:** While this project is much simpler, it introduces core ideas like **tokenization** (see `ch02/01_main-chapter-code/ch02.ipynb` or `ch02/05_bpe-from-scratch/bpe-from-scratch.ipynb` in the `llms-from-scratch` repo for advanced techniques) and **data processing pipelines**, which are fundamental to building LLMs from the ground up. This project is like learning the ABCs before writing an epic novel.

## ðŸ“‹ Module Structure

This lesson plan is divided into the following modules:

- **[Module 1: Introduction & Setting the Stage](module1-introduction.md)** - Overview of text processing and project setup
- **[Module 2: Core Python Concepts for Text Processing](module2-python-concepts.md)** - File handling, text cleaning, tokenization, and frequency counting
  - **[Module 2A: Core Text Processing Pipeline](module2A-core-pipeline.md)** - Technical implementation skills for building a working text analyzer
  - **[Module 2B: Code Design & Quality Practices](module2B-code-quality.md)** - Software engineering best practices for maintainable, professional-quality code
  - **[Module 2C: Professional Development Practices](module2C-professional-dev.md)** - Production workflows and advanced practices for robust and scalable code
- **[Module 3: Building the Script - Step-by-Step](module3-building-script.md)** - Implementation details and code examples
- **[Module 4: Testing and Refinement](module4-testing.md)** - Running, debugging, and improving the script
- **[Module 5: Connecting to the Bigger World of LLMs](module5-llm-connections.md)** - Understanding how this relates to LLM development

Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a complete text processing pipeline that serves as a foundation for understanding LLM preprocessing concepts.
