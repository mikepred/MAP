# Module 3: Building a Python Text Analysis Script - Complete Series Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Python Programming course! This module has been restructured into a comprehensive 5-part series that takes you from project setup to a fully functional text analysis script.

## ðŸŽ¯ Series Learning Objectives

By the end of this module series, you will be able to:

- Design and implement a complete Python project with proper architecture
- Handle file I/O operations with comprehensive error handling
- Build a text processing pipeline with multiple analysis functions
- Create professional-quality code with testing and documentation
- Integrate multiple components into a cohesive application
