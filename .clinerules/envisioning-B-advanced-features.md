# Module 2: Brainstorming & Designing Advanced Analysis Features

**Welcome to Module 2 of Envisioning Advancements!** With a more extensible foundation in mind (from Module 1), we now turn our attention to the exciting part: adding new, sophisticated analytical capabilities to the `text_analyzer`. This module is about ideation, design, and planning the integration of these features.

**Goal:** To identify, conceptualize, and outline the implementation strategy for several advanced text analysis features, focusing on their impact on `text_processing.py` and `analysis.py`.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Completion of [Module 1: Re-evaluating Foundations for Extensibility](envisioning-A-foundations.md).
*   Understanding of the current roles of `text_processing.py` and `analysis.py`.
*   Basic awareness of common NLP tasks (even if not expert-level).

**Key Areas of Focus:**

1.  **Feature Ideation:**
    *   Brainstorm a list of valuable NLP features that would enhance `text_analyzer` (e.g., sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition (NER), text summarization, keyword extraction like TF-IDF).
2.  **Technical Design for Each Feature:**
    *   For each chosen feature, outline the core logic.
    *   Identify necessary Python libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, Transformers).
    *   Determine how it would integrate with existing preprocessing steps in `text_processing.py`.
    *   Design new functions or classes for `analysis.py` to house the feature's logic.
    *   Consider how results would be structured and what new data points would be generated.
3.  **Impact on Existing Modules:**
    *   How will `config.py` need to change to support these features (e.g., model paths, API keys, lexicons)?
    *   How will `display.py` need to be updated to present the new results?
    *   How will `analyzer.py` menu or command structure accommodate these new analyses?

**Working with Your AI Coding Partner (Cline):**

*   **Feature Exploration & Prioritization:**
    *   "Cline, let's brainstorm 3-5 advanced NLP features suitable for `text_analyzer`. For each, briefly describe its value and potential complexity."
    *   "Given the educational goals of `text_analyzer`, which of these features (e.g., basic sentiment analysis vs. full topic modeling) would be a good next step in terms of learning curve and impact?"
*   **Technical Deep Dive (Example: Sentiment Analysis):**
    *   "Outline the steps to implement a basic lexicon-based sentiment analysis in `analysis.py`. What data structures would be needed for the lexicon? How would the sentiment score be calculated?"
    *   "Suggest a Python library (like NLTK's VADER or a custom lexicon) for sentiment analysis. How would we manage the lexicon file or library dependency?"
    *   "Draft a function signature for `analyze_sentiment(tokens: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]` that could be added to `analysis.py`."
*   **Integration Planning (Example: N-gram Analysis):**
    *   "If we add n-gram (bigram, trigram) frequency analysis, how should `tp.tokenize_text` or a new function in `text_processing.py` be adapted to generate n-grams from tokens?"
    *   "How would the output of n-gram analysis be structured in the results dictionary from `analysis.analyze_text_complete`?"
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   "If we decide to use spaCy for Named Entity Recognition, what are the implications for `requirements.txt` and potential model downloads? How can `config.py` manage paths to spaCy models?"

**Expected Outcomes:**

*   A prioritized list of 2-3 advanced features for initial development.
*   A high-level design document or notes for each chosen feature, detailing:
    *   Core logic and algorithms.
    *   Required libraries/dependencies.
    *   Integration points in `text_processing.py` and `analysis.py`.
    *   Expected output structure.
*   A clearer understanding of how new analytical modules can be "plugged into" the existing system.
