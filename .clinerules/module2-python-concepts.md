## üõ†Ô∏è Module 2: Python for Text Processing - Core Concepts

> **Overview:** This module serves as an entry point to the essential Python concepts and techniques needed to build our text processing pipeline. It is now structured into three focused sub-modules to provide a clearer and more manageable learning progression.

## üìã Module Structure

This comprehensive module is now divided into the following focused sub-modules:

- **üìö [Module 2A: Core Text Processing Pipeline](module2A-core-pipeline.md)**
  - **Focus:** Technical implementation skills for building a working text analyzer.
  - **Sections Covered:** 2.1-2.5 (File Handling, Text Cleaning, Tokenization, Counting Frequencies, Displaying Results)
  - **Estimated Time:** 1-1.5 hours
  - **Learning Objective:** Build a functional text analyzer from scratch.

- **üèóÔ∏è [Module 2B: Code Design & Quality Practices](module2B-code-quality.md)**
  - **Focus:** Software engineering best practices for maintainable, professional-quality code.
  - **Sections Covered:** 2.6-2.12 (Modular Design, Input Validation & Error Handling, Performance, Code Style, Testing Mindset, Configuration & Flexibility, Documentation Standards)
  - **Estimated Time:** 1.5-2 hours
  - **Learning Objective:** Transform working code into maintainable, professional-quality code.

- **üöÄ [Module 2C: Professional Development Practices](module2C-professional-dev.md)**
  - **Focus:** Production workflows and advanced practices for robust and scalable code.
  - **Sections Covered:** 2.13-2.16 (Debugging Tips, Future-Proofing, Code Organization, Real-World Considerations)
  - **Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes
  - **Learning Objective:** Apply industry-standard development workflows and prepare code for production use.

## üéØ Why This Split Works

1. **Clear Learning Progression:**
    - **2A:** "Can I build it?" (Technical skills)
    - **2B:** "Can I build it well?" (Code quality)
    - **2C:** "Can I maintain it professionally?" (Workflows)
2. **Manageable Cognitive Load:**
    - Reduces each module from 2.5-3 hours to 45-90 minutes.
    - Allows for natural breaks and reflection between concepts.
    - Students can master one level before moving to the next.
3. **Flexible Learning Paths:**
    - Immediate learners: Can complete 2A and have a working text analyzer.
    - Intermediate developers: Can focus on 2B for code improvement skills.
    - Advanced students: Can treat 2C as specialized professional development.
4. **Natural Assessment Points:**
    - After 2A: Working code demonstration.
    - After 2B: Code review and refactoring exercise.
    - After 2C: Professional workflow implementation.
5. **Coherent Narrative Arc:**
    - Each module builds naturally on the previous while being self-contained enough for modular delivery based on student needs and course pacing.
