## 🚧 Troubleshooting & Reflection Guide

### **Common Questions During This Module**

- **"How is my simple `text.split()` really like BPE?"**
  - Focus on the *goal*: breaking text into units. Your method is a basic form; BPE is a data-driven, sophisticated way to achieve a similar but more robust outcome for LLMs. See [Module 5A](module5A-foundations-llm-parallels.md#🔗-tokenization-from-simple-to-sophisticated).
- **"Are word counts still useful if LLMs use embeddings?"**
  - Yes! Frequency analysis provides valuable EDA, can be used for simpler models, and helps understand dataset characteristics. Embeddings are learned representations, often initialized or influenced by frequency. See [Module 5A](module5A-foundations-llm-parallels.md#🔤-from-word-counts-to-embeddings).
- **"Where should I start with `llms-from-scratch`?"**
  - Chapter 2 on tokenization is a great starting point as it directly builds on what you've learned. See [Module 5C](module5C-next-steps-learning-path.md#1-dive-into-llms-from-scratch).

### **Reflection Prompts**

- After completing Module 5A: How has your understanding of your own project changed now that you see its parallels with LLM preprocessing?
- After completing Module 5B: Which real-world application of text processing excites you the most and why?
- After completing Module 5C: What is one immediate next step you plan to take in your learning journey?

## 📖 Study Tips & Best Practices

- **Connect to Your Code:** As you read through Module 5, constantly refer back to the `analyzer.py` script you built. How would you modify it based on new concepts?
- **Hands-On with Libraries:** Don't just read about NLTK and spaCy; install them and try the example code snippets.
- **Explore `llms-from-scratch`:** Clone the repository and run the notebooks, especially those referenced in Module 5A and 5C.
- **Start Small with Projects:** The "Practical Projects to Bridge the Gap" in Module 5C are designed to be achievable next steps.
