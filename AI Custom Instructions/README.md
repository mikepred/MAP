# Cline's Global Rules: Master Index

This document provides an organized overview and quick reference to Cline's Global Rules. The rules are grouped thematically to clarify their relationships and intended application.

## Group 1: Core Operating Principles & Interaction

These rules define Cline's foundational operational philosophy and how Cline interacts with the user and manages knowledge.

1.  **[00-core-primary-directive.md](00-core-primary-directive.md):** Outlines Cline's core mission, focus, guiding principles, and commitment to quality.
2.  **[01-core-memory-bank-knowledge.md](01-core-memory-bank-knowledge.md):** Details the Memory Bank system, crucial for knowledge persistence across sessions, and the `.clinerules` for project-specific intelligence.
3.  **[02-core-interaction-iteration.md](02-core-interaction-iteration.md):** Defines the model for interaction, feedback incorporation, conciseness, scope management, and statefulness.
4.  **[03-core-tool-prioritization.md](03-core-tool-prioritization.md):** Defines the hierarchy for using built-in versus MCP server tools.

## Group 2: Code Creation Standards

These rules establish the standards for generating high-quality, maintainable, and robust code.

1.  **[10-code-language-excellence.md](10-code-language-excellence.md):** Specifies guidelines for idiomatic code, Python-specific best practices (including type hinting and virtual environments), and general language principles.
2.  **[11-code-architecture-principles.md](11-code-architecture-principles.md):** Outlines principles for well-structured code, covering modularity, reusability, clarity, configuration over hardcoding, error handling, and API design.
3.  **[12-code-modularity-extensibility.md](12-code-modularity-extensibility.md):** Emphasizes prioritizing modular design and promoting extensibility through patterns like plugin architectures, clear API boundaries, and configuration-driven behavior.

## Group 3: Development Workflow & Supporting Practices

These rules cover the broader development process, including documentation, tooling, and testing.

1.  **[20-workflow-documentation-communication.md](20-workflow-documentation-communication.md):** Sets standards for code documentation (docstrings, comments), communication language, file context, explanations, and the clarification protocol.
2.  **[21-workflow-tooling-security.md](21-workflow-tooling-security.md):** Outlines guidelines for version control (Git), testing (general principles), library/framework usage, performance considerations, and security best practices.
3.  **[22-workflow-testing-pytest-default.md](22-workflow-testing-pytest-default.md):** Establishes `pytest` as the default for test-aware development in Python, including proactive test generation and dependency management.

## Group 4: Proactive Application & Advanced Collaboration

This rule focuses on how Cline proactively engages in the development process, applying the established principles.

1.  **[30-proactive-feature-development.md](30-proactive-feature-development.md):** Describes how Cline should proactively collaborate on new feature development by offering to break down features, suggest technologies, draft code, propose testing strategies, and discuss impacts.
