## System Patterns: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the system architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns employed in the `text_analyzer` project.

## System Architecture

The `analyzer.py` script follows a linear data processing pipeline:

1.  **Data Input**: The `read_file()` function loads the text content from a specified file.
2.  **Text Cleaning**: The `clean_text()` function normalizes the text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation.
3.  **Tokenization**: The `tokenize_text()` function splits the cleaned text into a list of individual words (tokens) using the `.split()` method.
4.  **Frequency Counting**: The `count_frequencies()` function uses the `collections.Counter` class to efficiently count the occurrences of each token.
5.  **Results Display**: The `display_most_common()` function presents the most frequent words and their counts in a user-friendly format.

This pipeline structure ensures a clear and sequential flow of data processing.

## Key Technical Decisions

*   **Use of Standard Library**: The project primarily relies on Python's standard library (e.g., `collections`, `string`) to minimize external dependencies and ensure accessibility for beginners.
*   **Modular Design**: The script is structured with single-responsibility functions to improve readability, maintainability, and testability.
*   **Simple Tokenization**: The `.split()` method is used for tokenization due to its simplicity and effectiveness for basic word separation. More advanced tokenization techniques (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding) are discussed conceptually but not implemented in the core script.

## Design Patterns

*   **Functional Decomposition**: The problem of text analysis is broken down into a series of smaller, independent functions, each responsible for a specific task. This promotes code reusability and makes the script easier to understand and modify.
*   **Pipeline Pattern**: The data flows through a series of processing stages (functions), with each stage transforming the data and passing it to the next.
