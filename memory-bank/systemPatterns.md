## System Patterns: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the system architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns employed in the `text_analyzer` project.

## System Architecture

The `analyzer.py` script is designed to follow a linear data processing pipeline. As of the completion of Module 3B, the "Data Input" and "Error Handling" aspects are implemented. The full target pipeline is:

1.  **Data Input & Validation**: Functions like `read_file()`, `validate_file_path()`, and `get_filename_from_user()` handle loading text content from a specified file, ensuring the path is valid and handling potential I/O errors. (Implemented in Module 3B)
2.  **Text Cleaning**: The `clean_text()` function will normalize the text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation. (To be implemented in Module 3C)
3.  **Tokenization**: The `tokenize_text()` function will split the cleaned text into a list of individual words (tokens) using the `.split()` method. (To be implemented in Module 3C)
4.  **Frequency Counting**: The `count_frequencies()` function will use the `collections.Counter` class to efficiently count the occurrences of each token. (To be implemented in Module 3C)
5.  **Results Display**: The `display_most_common()` function will present the most frequent words and their counts in a user-friendly format. (To be implemented in Module 3D/3E)

This pipeline structure ensures a clear and sequential flow of data processing.

## Key Technical Decisions

*   **Use of Standard Library**: The project primarily relies on Python's standard library (e.g., `collections`, `string`) to minimize external dependencies and ensure accessibility for beginners.
*   **Modular Design**: The script is structured with single-responsibility functions to improve readability, maintainability, and testability.
*   **Simple Tokenization**: The `.split()` method is used for tokenization due to its simplicity and effectiveness for basic word separation. More advanced tokenization techniques (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding) are discussed conceptually but not implemented in the core script.

## Design Patterns

*   **Functional Decomposition**: The problem of text analysis is broken down into a series of smaller, independent functions, each responsible for a specific task. This promotes code reusability and makes the script easier to understand and modify.
*   **Pipeline Pattern**: The data flows through a series of processing stages (functions), with each stage transforming the data and passing it to the next.

## Cline's Operational System Patterns

My core operational directives, which define my behavior and collaboration, are documented as system patterns in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md`. These include:
*   **Proactive Partnership**: Embodying an expert, pragmatic, proactive, and efficient coding partner.
*   **Quality-Driven Delivery**: Consistently delivering clean, maintainable, secure, and idiomatic code.
*   **Profound User Intent Understanding**: Rigorously prioritizing explicit instructions while proactively seeking clarification for ambiguity.
*   **Continuous Learning & Knowledge Persistence**: Actively learning from interactions and maintaining the Memory Bank (`.clinerules`) for continuity and efficiency.
*   **Principled Development & Quality Assurance**: Applying established software engineering principles, including comprehensive documentation, robust testing, and integrated security.
