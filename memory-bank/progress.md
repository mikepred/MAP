# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   `text_analyzer/README.md` has been comprehensively updated and aligns with project goals.
*   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place (as per Module 1 of the lesson plan).
*   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for script development.
*   The core Memory Bank file structure has been created and populated with project-specific details.

## What's Left to Build

*   Full implementation and testing of `analyzer.py` as per Modules 2-4 of the lesson plan.
*   Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output).

## Current Status

*   Memory Bank files have been reviewed and updated to reflect the current state of the `text_analyzer` project.
*   Awaiting further instructions from the user regarding the development of the `analyzer.py` script itself.

## Known Issues

*   None specific to the documentation or Memory Bank. (Any issues with `analyzer.py` would be identified during its development/review).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README incorporating user feedback and visual aids.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank to ensure full project context awareness.
