# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   **Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture)**:
    *   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place.
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` contains the initial script structure.
*   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)**:
    *   Functions for `validate_file_path(filename)`, `read_file(filename)`, `get_filename_from_user()`, and `load_text_file()` are implemented and tested.
*   **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)**:
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now includes functions for:
        *   Text cleaning: `clean_text(text)`, `clean_text_for_words(text)`.
        *   Word analysis: `count_words(text)`, `get_unique_words(text)`, `get_word_count_stats(word_counts)`.
        *   Sentence analysis: `count_sentences(text)`, `analyze_sentences(text)`.
        *   Complete pipeline: `analyze_text_complete(text)`.
    *   The `main()` function in `analyzer.py` has been updated to test the Module 3C additions.
*   **Documentation & Setup**:
    *   `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive and aligned with project goals.
    *   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for script development.
    *   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are established and have been updated in the current session to reflect Module 3C completion.
    *   `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` was previously enhanced.
    *   Core directives in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` were previously refined.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Implementation of Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`**. This includes:
    *   Advanced statistical analysis functions.
    *   Professional results formatting and display functions.
    *   Updating the `main()` function to incorporate display choices.
*   Implementation and testing of `analyzer.py` for Module 3E (Integration & Testing).
*   Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output) after core Module 3 functionality is complete.

## Current Status

*   **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline) is complete.**
*   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` reflects the implementation of Modules 3A, 3B, and 3C.
*   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been updated in the current session to reflect this status.
*   **Ready to begin implementing Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**

## Known Issues

*   None specific to the current implementation or Memory Bank.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank.
*   Decision to enhance `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md`.
*   Previous decision to backtrack and reset `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` to Module 3A content.
*   Previous session: Confirmed `analyzer.py` status as Module 3B complete and updated Memory Bank files.
*   **Current session: Implemented Module 3C in `analyzer.py` and updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` accordingly.**
