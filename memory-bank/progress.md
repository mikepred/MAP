# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

* **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`) - Now on `main` branch**:
  * **Modules 1-4 (Original Lesson Plan)**: Fully completed, including all core functionalities and enhancements (stop word removal, user config, file output, advanced cleaning, word length analysis, timing).
  * **Module 5C (Initial NLP Library Exploration)**: Step 1 completed (NLTK/spaCy setup and basic exploration).
  * **Refactoring**: Significant refactoring for Pythonic best practices, type hinting, and improved structure has been completed.
  * **File Encoding Robustness**: `UnicodeDecodeError` handling improved with `iso-8859-1` in `file_io.py`.

* **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`) - On `main` branch**:
  * The script is functional for its core purpose of generating Mermaid `gitGraph` syntax for local branches.

* **Documentation & Setup**:
  * `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive.
  * The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for `text_analyzer.py`.
  * Core Memory Bank files are established and being updated.
  * Module 4 and 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module*-*.md`) restructured.

* **Repository State**:
  * The `develop` branch has been successfully merged into the `main` branch.
  * The `main` branch (local and remote `origin/main`) is up-to-date with all completed features.
  * The `develop` branch (local and remote `origin/develop`) has been updated from `main` and is also up-to-date.
  * The `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule is integrated and present on the `main` branch.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
    *   **Continue with Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps"**:
        *   Step 2: Experiment with Real-World Data.
        *   Step 3: Build an Enhanced Version of the Project or a New Small Project.
    *   **Potential Future Enhancements (beyond current lesson plan/review)**:
        *   Advanced NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
        *   GUI implementation.
        *   Support for different file formats (PDF, DOCX).
        *   More sophisticated automated testing.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
    *   Potential future enhancements as previously listed (e.g., robust error handling, remote branch visualization, alternative layouts, user arguments).

## Current Status

*   **Overall Learning Plan**:
    *   The overarching goal is self-directed AI engineering education, focusing on LLMs from scratch (guided by Raschka's book/repo) using "SAI" as a conceptual learning framework.
    *   The "AI Engineering Master Curriculum" (`This comprehensive lesson plan takes a l.md`) serves as an inspirational reference.
    *   The "Generative AI with Python and PyTorch, Second Edition" PDF (GenAI PDF) has been identified as a key theoretical and practical textbook.
    *   The `text_analyzer` project is a foundational practical exercise.
    *   Memory Bank and MCP Knowledge Graph are established for progress tracking.
*   **Current Learning Focus**: "Text representation/early NLP," with specific attention to Chapter 3 of the "GenAI PDF" and its relation to Raschka's Chapter 2.
*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`) - On `main` branch**:
    *   Fully functional as per Modules 1-4 of its original lesson plan.
    *   Initial Module 5C exploration (NLTK/spaCy) completed.
    *   Refactored for Pythonic best practices.
    *   File encoding issue (`UnicodeDecodeError`) resolved (`iso-8859-1` in `file_io.py`).
*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`) - On `main` branch**:
    *   Functional.
*   **Repository State**:
    *   `main` branch is stable and up-to-date with all completed features.
    *   `develop` branch is synchronized with `main`.
    *   `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule is integrated.
*   **Deployment**: NumPy incompatibility on Render resolved (`numpy<2.0`).
*   **Memory Bank**: Updated to reflect the refined learning strategy and incorporation of new learning resources (Raschka's "Build an LLM From Scratch", "Generative AI with Python and PyTorch" PDF).

## Known Issues

* **Text Analyzer**:
  * The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` could be expanded for more rigorous automated testing.
* **Deployment**:
  * While the NumPy incompatibility is resolved, future dependency updates for `spaCy` or `thinc` might require re-evaluation of NumPy version constraints.
* **Git Branch Visualizer**:
  * Limitations regarding complex Git histories, performance on very large repos, and main line detection persist as areas for potential improvement.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

* Initial decision: Establish Cline's Memory Bank system.
* Decision: Create a comprehensive README for Text Analyzer.
* Decision: Systematically update Memory Bank.
* Previous session: Completed Modules 3A-3E for Text Analyzer.
* Earlier in current session:
  * Introduced `branch_visualizer.py`.
  * Updated Memory Bank for Git Branch Visualizer.
  * Restructured Module 4 & 5 `.clinerules` documentation.
  * Completed Text Analyzer Module 4 (A, B, C).
  * Reviewed Module 5 documentation and initiated Module 5C Step 1 (NLTK/spaCy exploration).
* **Current session (continued)**:
    *   **Learning Strategy Refinement**: Key learning resources (Raschka, GenAI PDF, Master Curriculum) and their roles have been clarified. "SAI" confirmed as the conceptual framework. This is reflected in updated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
    *   **Memory Bank Update**: Completed for `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `techContext.md` to reflect the refined learning strategy.
