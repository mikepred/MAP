# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
    *   **Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3E (Integration & Testing)**: Fully completed. The core text analysis script as defined by Modules 3A-3E is fully functional.
    *   **Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed**:
        *   Script execution verified.
        *   Debugging fundamentals reviewed.
    *   **Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) Completed**:
        *   Enhancement 1 (Stop Word Removal): `remove_stop_words()` implemented and integrated.
        *   Enhancement 2 (User Input for Configuration): `get_user_input_config()` implemented and integrated for filepath, top N words, and stop word toggle.
        *   Enhancement 3 (Output to File): `save_results_to_file()` implemented and integrated with user prompt.
    *   **Module 4C (Advanced Refinements and Performance) Completed**:
        *   `clean_text()` enhanced with an `advanced` flag for URL/email removal.
        *   `analyze_word_lengths()` function added and integrated.
        *   `time_function()` utility added and overall pipeline timing implemented.
        *   `NameError` for `tokenize_text` and other syntax issues resolved.
    *   The `text_analyzer.py` script is now fully enhanced as per the Module 4 lesson plan.
    *   **Module 5C (Initial Exploration - "Immediate Next Steps" Step 1) In Progress**:
        *   Reviewed Module 5 documentation (overview, navigation, sub-modules 5A, 5B, 5C).
        *   Installed NLTK and spaCy libraries.
        *   Downloaded NLTK data (`punkt`, `stopwords`, `punkt_tab`) and spaCy model (`en_core_web_sm`).
        *   Created and executed `text_analyzer/explore_nlp_libraries.py` to demonstrate basic functionalities.

*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
    *   The script successfully fetches local Git branch names using `git for-each-ref`.
    *   It fetches complete Git log data (SHAs, parent SHAs, refs) in chronological order using `git log --all --pretty=format:"%H|%P|%D" --date-order --reverse`.
    *   It parses commit references to identify local branches pointing to specific commits.
    *   It generates valid Mermaid `gitGraph LR;` syntax representing the local branch structure, including commits and merges.
    *   It saves the generated Mermaid code to `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt`.
    *   Basic error handling for `git` command execution (e.g., Git not found) and file output is implemented.
    *   **The `branch_visualizer.py` script is functional for its core purpose.**

*   **Documentation & Setup**:
    *   `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive and aligned with project goals.
    *   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for `text_analyzer.py` development.
    *   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are established and are being updated to reflect current progress.
    *   Module 4 documentation (`.clinerules/module4-*.md`) has been restructured into a series of focused sub-modules.
    *   Module 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module5-*.md`) has been restructured into a series of focused sub-modules.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
    *   The core lesson plan (Modules 1-5, with Modules 1-4 resulting in code) is complete.
    *   Potential future enhancements (beyond the current lesson plan) could include:
        *   More sophisticated NLP tasks (e.g., stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging using NLTK/spaCy).
        *   Graphical display of word frequencies (e.g., bar charts).
        *   Support for different input file formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).
        *   More comprehensive automated testing.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
    *   More robust error handling for diverse or unusual Git repository states.
    *   Options for visualizing remote branches or specific branch subsets.
    *   Alternative layout options for the Mermaid graph (e.g., Top-Down).
    *   Improved identification of merge sources in complex histories.
    *   User arguments for specifying repository path or output file name.

## Current Status

*   **Overall Project**: The MAP project now comprises two main functional Python scripts: `text_analyzer.py` (Module 4 enhancements completed, Module 5 exploration started) and `branch_visualizer.py` (functional).
*   **Text Analyzer**: Fully functional as per Modules 1-4 of the lesson plan. All planned enhancements from Module 4 (A, B, C) are implemented. Module 5 (conceptual connections to LLMs) has been reviewed, and initial practical exploration of NLTK/spaCy (Module 5C, Step 1) is complete.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer**: Functional for generating Mermaid graphs of local Git branches.
*   **Memory Bank**: Currently being updated to reflect the Module 5 exploration for the Text Analyzer.
*   **Git Branch**: (User to confirm if specific branch tracking is needed for this phase).

## Known Issues

*   **Text Analyzer**:
    *   The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` has simplified/simulated tests for some components; could be expanded for more rigorous automated testing.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer**:
    *   The visualization accuracy depends on the `git log` output format and parsing logic; very complex or non-standard Git histories might not render perfectly.
    *   Performance might degrade on repositories with extremely large numbers of commits or branches.
    *   The logic for determining the "main line" for Mermaid checkout could be made more robust for repositories not using `main` or `master`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README for the Text Analyzer.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank for all project changes.
*   Previous session: Completed Modules 3A-3E for the Text Analyzer project.
*   Earlier in current session:
    *   Introduced the `branch_visualizer.py` script and `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt` example.
    *   Updated all core Memory Bank files to reflect the addition and functionality of the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   Restructured Module 4 documentation into a series of sub-modules.
    *   Restructured Module 5 documentation into a series of sub-modules.
*   **Current session (continued)**:
    *   Started Module 4 for Text Analyzer.
    *   Completed Module 4A (testing and review of `analyzer.py`).
    *   Implemented Module 4B (all enhancements) in `text_analyzer.py`.
    *   Implemented Module 4C (all enhancements) in `text_analyzer.py`, including fixing runtime errors.
    *   Reviewed Module 5 documentation.
    *   Initiated Module 5C Step 1: Installed NLTK, spaCy, and necessary data/models; created and ran `explore_nlp_libraries.py`.
    *   Currently updating Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect this Module 5 progress.
