# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
    *   **Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions)**: Fully completed.
    *   **Module 3E (Integration & Testing)**: Fully completed. The core text analysis script as defined by Modules 3A-3E is fully functional.
    *   **Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed**:
        *   Script execution verified with updated `sample.txt`.
        *   Debugging fundamentals reviewed.
    *   **Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) - In Progress**:
        *   Enhancement 1 (Stop Word Removal) implemented:
            *   `remove_stop_words()` function added.
            *   `count_words()` and `analyze_text_complete()` updated to support optional stop word removal.
            *   `main()` updated to enable stop word removal by default (hardcoded `True`).
            *   Script tested successfully with stop word removal active.
            *   `analyze_text_complete` updated to return the full `word_counts` object (as `full_word_counts_obj`) for use in `display_complete_analysis`.

*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
    *   The script successfully fetches local Git branch names using `git for-each-ref`.
    *   It fetches complete Git log data (SHAs, parent SHAs, refs) in chronological order using `git log --all --pretty=format:"%H|%P|%D" --date-order --reverse`.
    *   It parses commit references to identify local branches pointing to specific commits.
    *   It generates valid Mermaid `gitGraph LR;` syntax representing the local branch structure, including commits and merges.
    *   It saves the generated Mermaid code to `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt`.
    *   Basic error handling for `git` command execution (e.g., Git not found) and file output is implemented.
    *   **The `branch_visualizer.py` script is functional for its core purpose.**

*   **Documentation & Setup**:
    *   `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive and aligned with project goals.
    *   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for `text_analyzer.py` development.
    *   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are established and are being updated to reflect current progress.
    *   Module 4 documentation (`.clinerules/module4-*.md`) has been restructured into a series of focused sub-modules.
    *   Module 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module5-*.md`) has been restructured into a series of focused sub-modules.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
    *   **Complete Module 4B enhancements**:
        *   Implement Enhancement 2: User Input for Configuration (making stop word removal, input file, and number of top words configurable by the user at runtime).
        *   Implement Enhancement 3: Output to File (allowing users to save analysis results).
    *   **Proceed with Module 4C enhancements**:
        *   Advanced text cleaning.
        *   Word length analysis.
        *   Performance timing and considerations.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
    *   More robust error handling for diverse or unusual Git repository states.
    *   Options for visualizing remote branches or specific branch subsets.
    *   Alternative layout options for the Mermaid graph (e.g., Top-Down).
    *   Improved identification of merge sources in complex histories.
    *   User arguments for specifying repository path or output file name.

## Current Status

*   **Overall Project**: The MAP project now comprises two main functional Python scripts: `text_analyzer.py` (undergoing Module 4 enhancements) and `branch_visualizer.py` (functional).
*   **Text Analyzer**: Fully functional as per Modules 3A-3E. Module 4A completed. Module 4B, Enhancement 1 (Stop Word Removal) implemented and tested.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer**: Functional for generating Mermaid graphs of local Git branches.
*   **Memory Bank**: Currently being updated to reflect progress on Text Analyzer Module 4.
*   **Git Branch**: Work on Text Analyzer Module 4 enhancements has commenced. (Specific branch name to be confirmed by user if relevant for future reference).

## Known Issues

*   **Text Analyzer**:
    *   The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` has simplified/simulated tests for some components; could be expanded for more rigorous automated testing.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer**:
    *   The visualization accuracy depends on the `git log` output format and parsing logic; very complex or non-standard Git histories might not render perfectly.
    *   Performance might degrade on repositories with extremely large numbers of commits or branches.
    *   The logic for determining the "main line" for Mermaid checkout could be made more robust for repositories not using `main` or `master`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README for the Text Analyzer.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank for all project changes.
*   Previous session: Completed Modules 3A-3E for the Text Analyzer project.
*   Earlier in current session:
    *   Introduced the `branch_visualizer.py` script and `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt` example.
    *   Updated all core Memory Bank files to reflect the addition and functionality of the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   Restructured Module 4 documentation into a series of sub-modules.
    *   Restructured Module 5 documentation into a series of sub-modules.
*   **Current session (continued)**:
    *   Started Module 4 for Text Analyzer.
    *   Completed Module 4A (testing and review of `analyzer.py`).
    *   Implemented Module 4B, Enhancement 1 (Stop Word Removal) in `text_analyzer.py`.
    *   Currently updating Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect this progress.
