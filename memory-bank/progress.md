# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
    *   **Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture)**:
        *   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place.
        *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` contains the initial script structure.
    *   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)**:
        *   Functions for `validate_file_path(filename)`, `read_file(filename)`, `get_filename_from_user()`, and `load_text_file()` are implemented and tested.
    *   **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)**:
        *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` includes functions for text cleaning, word analysis, sentence analysis, and a complete pipeline (`analyze_text_complete(text)`).
        *   The `main()` function in `analyzer.py` was updated to test Module 3C additions.
    *   **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions)**:
        *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` includes functions for advanced statistical analysis, professional results formatting, a complete display system, and an updated `main()` function with display choices.
        *   The script with Module 3D changes was tested successfully.
    *   **Module 3E (Integration & Testing)**:
        *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` contains the fully integrated code, including the final `main()` function with a menu system, a `run_comprehensive_test()` function, and help information.
        *   **The core text analysis script as defined by Modules 3A-3E is fully functional.**

*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
    *   The script successfully fetches local Git branch names using `git for-each-ref`.
    *   It fetches complete Git log data (SHAs, parent SHAs, refs) in chronological order using `git log --all --pretty=format:"%H|%P|%D" --date-order --reverse`.
    *   It parses commit references to identify local branches pointing to specific commits.
    *   It generates valid Mermaid `gitGraph LR;` syntax representing the local branch structure, including commits and merges.
    *   It saves the generated Mermaid code to `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt`.
    *   Basic error handling for `git` command execution (e.g., Git not found) and file output is implemented.
    *   **The `branch_visualizer.py` script is functional for its core purpose.**

*   **Documentation & Setup**:
    *   `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive and aligned with project goals.
    *   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for `text_analyzer.py` development.
    *   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are established and have been updated in the current session to reflect the completion of the Text Analyzer's Module 3E and the introduction of the Git Branch Visualizer.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Text Analyzer Project**:
    *   Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input for file output name, advanced cleaning options, word length analysis, performance timing) as outlined in `.clinerules/module4-testing.md`.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project**:
    *   More robust error handling for diverse or unusual Git repository states.
    *   Options for visualizing remote branches or specific branch subsets.
    *   Alternative layout options for the Mermaid graph (e.g., Top-Down).
    *   Improved identification of merge sources in complex histories.
    *   User arguments for specifying repository path or output file name.

## Current Status

*   **Overall Project**: The MAP project now comprises two main functional Python scripts: `text_analyzer.py` and `branch_visualizer.py`.
*   **Text Analyzer**: Fully functional as per Modules 3A-3E of its lesson plan.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer**: Functional for generating Mermaid graphs of local Git branches.
*   **Memory Bank**: Updated in the current session to incorporate details of both the Text Analyzer (Module 3E completion) and the new Git Branch Visualizer.
*   **Git Branch**: Currently on `module/3D-analysis-display` (this branch was for Text Analyzer work; new work on Branch Visualizer or further Text Analyzer enhancements should ideally be on new, appropriately named branches).

## Known Issues

*   **Text Analyzer**:
    *   The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` has simplified/simulated tests for File I/O and Display functionality. True tests would require more complex setups.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer**:
    *   The visualization accuracy depends on the `git log` output format and parsing logic; very complex or non-standard Git histories might not render perfectly.
    *   Performance might degrade on repositories with extremely large numbers of commits or branches.
    *   The logic for determining the "main line" for Mermaid checkout could be made more robust for repositories not using `main` or `master`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README for the Text Analyzer.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank for all project changes.
*   Previous session: Completed Modules 3A-3E for the Text Analyzer project.
*   Current session:
    *   Introduced the `branch_visualizer.py` script and `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt` example.
    *   **Updated all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect the addition and functionality of the Git Branch Visualizer.**
