# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   `text_analyzer/README.md` has been comprehensively updated and aligns with project goals.
*   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place (as per Module 1 of the lesson plan).
*   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for script development.
*   The core Memory Bank file structure has been created and populated with project-specific details.
*   `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` has been enhanced with additional best practices, guidelines, and a table of contents.
*   The updated `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` has been successfully pushed to the GitHub repository (`mikepred/MAP`, branch `main`).
*   **MAJOR MILESTONE:** `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` has been fully implemented with a complete text processing pipeline including robust file reading, flexible text cleaning, tokenization, frequency counting, and result display functions.
*   The lesson plan structure has been updated to properly reflect the Module 2 sub-modules (2A, 2B, 2C) organization.

## What's Left to Build

* Testing and validation of the complete `analyzer.py` implementation (Module 4 of the lesson plan).
* Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output).
* Documentation updates to reflect the completed implementation.

## Current Status

* Memory Bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md) have been fully reviewed as of May 25, 2025, ensuring alignment with the latest project status and recent updates.
* `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` has been updated and pushed to GitHub.
* **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** The complete `analyzer.py` implementation is now ready with all core text processing functions implemented.
* Ready to begin Module 4 (Testing and Refinement) of the lesson plan.

## Known Issues

*   None specific to the documentation or Memory Bank. (Any issues with `analyzer.py` would be identified during its development/review).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

* Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
* Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README incorporating user feedback and visual aids.
* Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank to ensure full project context awareness.
* Decision to enhance `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` with best practices, guidelines, and a table of contents.

### Major Development Timeline

- **Project Initialization & Core Structure (`text_analyzer/`):**

  - The `text_analyzer` project directory was created.
  - Initial placeholder files `analyzer.py` (for the main script) and `sample.txt` (for test data) were established.
  - A `README.md` file for the `text_analyzer` project was created and has since been comprehensively updated to align with project goals.

- **Development of the Educational Lesson Plan (`.clinerules/`):**

  - A detailed, multi-module lesson plan titled "Python for Text Processing - A Foundation for LLMs" was created and structured within the `.clinerules` directory. This plan serves as the primary guide for developing the `analyzer.py` script.

  - The lesson plan is broken down into five core modules:

    - **Module 1:** Introduction & Setting the Stage (`module1-introduction.md`)

    - **Module 2:** Core Python Concepts for Text Processing (`module2-python-concepts.md`), which was further refined into sub-modules:

      - `module2A-core-pipeline.md` (Technical implementation)
      - `module2B-code-quality.md` (Code design and quality)
      - `module2C-professional-dev.md` (Professional development practices)

    - **Module 3:** Building the Script - Step-by-Step (`module3-building-script.md`)

    - **Module 4:** Testing and Refinement (`module4-testing.md`)

    - **Module 5:** Connecting to the Bigger World of LLMs (`module5-llm-connections.md`)

  - Significant effort went into detailing the content for each module, including concepts, activities, code examples, and best practices.

  - Notably, `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` (and its sub-modules) received specific enhancements to include more comprehensive best practices, guidelines, and structural improvements like tables of contents.

- **Establishment and Maintenance of Cline's Memory Bank (`memory-bank/`):**

  - The Memory Bank system was established as a foundational element for project context and continuity.

  - All core Memory Bank files were created and populated with details specific to the `text_analyzer` project:

    - `projectbrief.md`: Defines core requirements and goals.
    - `productContext.md`: Outlines the "why" of the project.
    - `systemPatterns.md`: Describes architecture and design patterns.
    - `techContext.md`: Covers technologies and dependencies.
    - `activeContext.md`: Tracks current focus and recent changes.
    - `progress.md`: Logs achievements, next steps, and status.

  - These Memory Bank files have been reviewed and updated recently (as of May 25, 2025) to ensure they accurately reflect the current project status and incorporate all recent developments.

- **GitHub Integration:**

  - Updates, such as the enhanced `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md`, have been noted as pushed to the `main` branch of the `mikepred/MAP` GitHub repository.
