# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   `text_analyzer/README.md` has been comprehensively updated and aligns with project goals.
*   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place (as per Module 1 of the lesson plan).
*   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for script development.
*   The core Memory Bank file structure has been created and populated with project-specific details.
*   `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` has been enhanced with additional best practices, guidelines, and a table of contents.
*   The updated `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` has been successfully pushed to the GitHub repository (`mikepred/MAP`, branch `main`).
*   `memory-bank/techContext.md` updated to reflect virtual environment recommendations.
*   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now contains the initial script structure as defined in Module 3A.
*   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` has been updated to reflect the project state.
*   **Core Directive Refinement**: The `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` file was refined to solidify core operational principles, including continuous learning and principled development.
*   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling) Completed**:
    *   Implemented `validate_file_path`, `read_file`, `get_filename_from_user`, and `load_text_file` functions in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
    *   Successfully tested file reading, error handling for non-existent files, and directory input.
    *   Changes committed to `module/3B-file-io` branch and pushed to origin.
*   **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline) Completed**:
    *   Implemented `clean_text`, `clean_text_for_words`, `count_words`, `get_unique_words`, `get_word_count_stats`, `count_sentences`, `analyze_sentences`, and `analyze_text_complete` functions in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
    *   Updated the `main` function to test the text processing pipeline.
*   **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) Completed**:
    *   Implemented advanced statistical analysis functions (`calculate_readability_stats`, `find_interesting_patterns`).
    *   Implemented professional display helper functions (`print_header`, `print_section`).
    *   Implemented specific display functions (`display_general_statistics`, `display_word_analysis`, `display_sentence_analysis`, `display_readability_analysis`, `display_interesting_patterns`).
    *   Implemented complete display system functions (`display_complete_analysis`, `display_summary`).
    *   Updated the `main` function to integrate these new display options.

## What's Left to Build

*   Implementation and testing of `analyzer.py` for Module 3E (Integration & Testing).
*   Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output) after core Module 3 functionality is complete.

## Current Status

*   **Module 3D Complete**: Analysis and display functions are implemented and integrated.
*   Currently on `module-3c-text-processing-pipeline` branch, ready to begin implementing Module 3E (Integration & Testing) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are being updated to reflect the current state.

## Known Issues

*   None specific to the documentation or Memory Bank.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README incorporating user feedback and visual aids.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank to ensure full project context awareness.
*   Decision to enhance `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` with best practices, guidelines, and a table of contents.
*   **Decision to adopt a "preserved main with a development line" Git strategy**:
    *   `main` branch remains stable (currently at Module 3A completion).
    *   `develop` branch serves as the integration point for completed modules.
    *   New module-specific branches (e.g., `module/3B-file-io`, `module/3C-text-processing`) are branched from `develop`, developed, and then merged back into `develop`.
    *   The `develop` branch will be merged into `main` only at major release points.
