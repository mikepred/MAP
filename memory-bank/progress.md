# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions, all pertaining to the Text Analyzer.

## What Works

* **Text Analyzer Project (`text_analyzer/` and `web_application/`)**:
  * **Core Functionality (Original Lesson Plan Modules 1-4)**: Fully completed.
  * **Advanced NLP Features**:
    * N-gram analysis (bigrams, trigrams).
    * Sentiment analysis (VADER).
    * Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Lexical Density (spaCy).
    * Named Entity Recognition (NER) (spaCy).
    * Readability assessment (multiple standard indices via `textstat`).
    * Keyword Extraction (RAKE algorithm via `rake-nltk`).
  * **Input/Output Enhancements**:
    * Support for CSV and JSON file inputs (extracting text from specified columns/keys).
    * Graphical plot generation (`matplotlib`) for word frequencies, sentiment distribution, and word length distribution. Plots are saved to `text_analyzer/analysis_plots/` (this directory will be gitignored).
    * Dynamic stop word management (default English, NLTK languages, custom file, or none).
  * **Refactoring**: Significant refactoring for Pythonic best practices, type hinting, and improved structure has been completed.
  * **File Encoding Robustness**: `UnicodeDecodeError` handling improved with `iso-8859-1` in `file_io.py` for text files; UTF-8 used for JSON and custom stop word files.
  * **Web Application (`web_application/app.py`)**: Basic functionality for web-based text analysis.
  * **Desktop GUI (`text_analyzer/gui.py`)**: Basic Tkinter GUI for text analysis.

* **Documentation & Setup**:
  * `README.md` is comprehensive (will be updated for new structure).
  * Core Memory Bank files are established and being updated to focus solely on the Text Analyzer.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Text Analyzer Project**:
    *   **Continue with Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps" (from original plan)**:
        *   Step 2: Experiment with Real-World Data (using the newly enhanced analyzer).
        *   Step 3: Consider if further enhancements are needed or if a new small project is more beneficial for learning.
    *   **Potential Future Enhancements (if desired)**:
        *   Full TF-IDF implementation (currently a placeholder in some older plans).
        *   Support for other file formats (PDF, DOCX).
        *   More sophisticated automated testing in `run_comprehensive_test()` to cover all new features.
        *   Enhancements to the Web Application and Desktop GUI.
    *   Update paths in deployment files (`Procfile`, `render.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `setup.sh`) after web app reorganization.
    *   Update paths in `web_application/app.py`, `web_application/tests/test_app.py`, `web_application/wsgi.py` after reorganization.
    *   Update `README.md` to reflect new structure and commands.

## Current Status

*   **Text Analyzer Project**:
    *   Significantly enhanced with CSV/JSON input, graphical plotting, RAKE keyword extraction, and dynamic stop word management.
    *   Core functionalities and previous advanced NLP features (N-grams, VADER sentiment, spaCy POS/NER, readability) remain operational.
    *   `FIXED_TARGET_FILENAME` in `config.py` is currently `test_plot_sample.txt` (may need to be changed to a more generic default like `sample.txt`).
    *   Web application files are being reorganized into `web_application/`.
*   **Deployment**: NumPy incompatibility on Render previously resolved (`numpy<2.0`). This needs to be ensured in the unified `requirements.txt`.

## Known Issues

* **Text Analyzer**:
  * The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` needs significant updates to cover the new features (CSV/JSON input, plotting, RAKE, dynamic stop words).
  * NLTK language stop word selection in `analyzer.py` relies on `cfg.SUPPORTED_NLTK_STOPWORD_LANGUAGES`; a more dynamic check against `stopwords.fileids()` could be more robust if NLTK data path is consistently available.
* **Deployment**:
  * Dependency versions (spaCy, thinc, NumPy) might need future monitoring for compatibility.

## Evolution of Project Decisions (Text Analyzer Focused)

* Initial decision: Establish Cline's Memory Bank system for the Text Analyzer.
* Decision: Create a comprehensive README for Text Analyzer.
* Decision: Systematically update Memory Bank for Text Analyzer.
* Previous session: Completed Modules 3A-3E for Text Analyzer, initial Module 5C work.
* Earlier in current session (related to Text Analyzer):
  * Completed Text Analyzer Module 4 (A, B, C).
  * Reviewed Module 5 documentation and initiated Module 5C Step 1 (NLTK/spaCy exploration).
* **Current session (continued for Text Analyzer)**:
    *   **`text_analyzer` Enhancements**:
        *   Added CSV and JSON input support.
        *   Added graphical plotting for word frequencies, sentiment, and word lengths.
        *   Added RAKE keyword extraction.
        *   Added dynamic stop word management.
    *   **Repository Cleanup**: Currently in progress to focus the repository solely on the Text Analyzer, including reorganizing web application files and pruning Memory Bank.
