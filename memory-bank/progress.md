# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   **Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture)**:
    *   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place.
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` contains the initial script structure.
*   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)**:
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now includes robust functions for:
        *   `validate_file_path(filename)`
        *   `read_file(filename)`
        *   `get_filename_from_user()`
        *   `load_text_file()`
    *   The `main()` function in `analyzer.py` tests these I/O operations.
*   **Documentation & Setup**:
    *   `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive and aligned with project goals.
    *   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for script development.
    *   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are established and have been updated in the current session.
    *   `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` was previously enhanced.
    *   Core directives in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` were previously refined.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Implementation of Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`**. This includes:
    *   `clean_text(text)` and `clean_text_for_words(text)`
    *   `count_words(text)`, `get_unique_words(text)`, `get_word_count_stats(word_counts)`
    *   `count_sentences(text)`, `analyze_sentences(text)`
    *   `analyze_text_complete(text)`
*   Implementation of Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   Implementation and testing of `analyzer.py` for Module 3E (Integration & Testing).
*   Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output) after core Module 3 functionality is complete.

## Current Status

*   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling) is complete.**
*   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` reflects the implementation of Module 3B.
*   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been updated in the current session to reflect this status.
*   **Ready to begin implementing Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**

## Known Issues

*   None specific to the current implementation or Memory Bank.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank.
*   Decision to enhance `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md`.
*   Previous decision to backtrack and reset `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` to Module 3A content.
*   **Current session: Confirmed `analyzer.py` status as Module 3B complete and updated all Memory Bank files accordingly.**
