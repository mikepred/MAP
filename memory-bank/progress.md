# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   `text_analyzer/README.md` has been comprehensively updated and aligns with project goals.
*   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place (as per Module 1 of the lesson plan).
*   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for script development.
*   The core Memory Bank file structure has been created and populated with project-specific details.
*   `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` has been enhanced with additional best practices, guidelines, and a table of contents.
*   The updated `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` has been successfully pushed to the GitHub repository (`mikepred/MAP`, branch `main`).
*   `memory-bank/techContext.md` updated to reflect virtual environment recommendations.
*   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` has been reset and now contains the initial script structure as defined in Module 3A.
*   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` has been updated to reflect the project reset.

## What's Left to Build

*   Implementation of Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   Implementation of Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   Implementation of Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   Implementation and testing of `analyzer.py` for Module 3E (Integration & Testing).
*   Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output) after core Module 3 functionality is complete.

## Current Status

*   **Project Reset**: `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` has been reset to its initial state as defined in Module 3A.
*   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been updated to reflect this reset.
*   Ready to begin implementing Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.

## Known Issues

*   None specific to the documentation or Memory Bank.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README incorporating user feedback and visual aids.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank to ensure full project context awareness.
*   Decision to enhance `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` with best practices, guidelines, and a table of contents.
*   **Decision to backtrack and reset `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` to Module 3A content due to user request.**
