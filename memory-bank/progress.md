# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

*   **Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture)**:
    *   Initial project structure (`text_analyzer` directory, `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`) is in place.
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` contains the initial script structure.
*   **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)**:
    *   Functions for `validate_file_path(filename)`, `read_file(filename)`, `get_filename_from_user()`, and `load_text_file()` are implemented and tested.
*   **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)**:
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now includes functions for:
        *   Text cleaning: `clean_text(text)`, `clean_text_for_words(text)`.
        *   Word analysis: `count_words(text)`, `get_unique_words(text)`, `get_word_count_stats(word_counts)`.
        *   Sentence analysis: `count_sentences(text)`, `analyze_sentences(text)`.
        *   Complete pipeline: `analyze_text_complete(text)`.
    *   The `main()` function in `analyzer.py` has been updated to test the Module 3C additions.
*   **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions)**:
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now includes functions for:
        *   Advanced statistical analysis (`calculate_readability_stats`, `find_interesting_patterns`).
        *   Professional results formatting and display (`print_header`, `print_section`, `display_general_statistics`, `display_word_analysis`, `display_sentence_analysis`, `display_readability_analysis`, `display_interesting_patterns`).
        *   A complete display system (`display_complete_analysis`, `display_summary`).
    *   The `main()` function has been updated to offer display choices and test Module 3D functionality.
    *   The script with Module 3D changes has been tested successfully.
*   **Module 3E (Integration & Testing)**:
    *   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now contains the fully integrated code as per Module 3E.
    *   This includes the final `main()` function with a menu system, a `run_comprehensive_test()` function, and help information.
*   **Documentation & Setup**:
    *   `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive and aligned with project goals.
    *   The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for script development.
    *   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are established and have been updated in the current session to reflect Module 3E completion.
    *   `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` was previously enhanced.
    *   Core directives in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` were previously refined.

## What's Left to Build

*   Potential enhancements from Module 4 (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output, advanced cleaning, word length analysis, performance timing) as outlined in `.clinerules/module4-testing.md`.

## Current Status

*   **Module 3E (Integration & Testing) is complete.**
*   `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` reflects the full implementation of Modules 3A through 3E.
*   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been updated in the current session to reflect this status.
*   Currently on branch `module/3D-analysis-display`.
*   **The core text analysis script as defined by Modules 3A-3E is now fully functional.**

## Known Issues

*   The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` has simplified/simulated tests for File I/O and Display functionality. True tests for these would require more complex setups (e.g., creating temporary files for I/O, capturing stdout for display).
*   The `calculate_readability_stats` function in `display_complete_analysis` was initially passed an empty string for `text` because the original text wasn't directly available in that scope. This has been rectified by adding `original_text` to the `analyze_text_complete` results.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Initial decision: Establish the Cline's Memory Bank system as the foundation for all future work.
*   Decision to create a comprehensive, educational README.
*   Decision to systematically review and update the Memory Bank.
*   Decision to enhance `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md`.
*   Previous decision to backtrack and reset `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` to Module 3A content.
*   Previous session: Confirmed `analyzer.py` status as Module 3B complete and updated Memory Bank files.
*   Current session:
    *   Implemented Module 3C in `analyzer.py`.
    *   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for Module 3C.
    *   Committed and pushed Module 3C changes to `origin/module/3C-text-pipeline`.
    *   Created new branch `module/3D-analysis-display`.
    *   Implemented Module 3D in `analyzer.py` on the new branch.
    *   Tested Module 3D successfully.
    *   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for Module 3D completion.
    *   **Implemented Module 3E in `analyzer.py` by writing the complete integrated script.**
    *   **Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for Module 3E completion.**
