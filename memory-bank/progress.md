# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

* **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`) - Now on `main` branch**:
  * **Core Functionality (Original Lesson Plan Modules 1-4)**: Fully completed.
  * **Advanced NLP Features**:
    * N-gram analysis (bigrams, trigrams).
    * Sentiment analysis (VADER).
    * Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and Lexical Density (spaCy).
    * Named Entity Recognition (NER) (spaCy).
    * Readability assessment (multiple standard indices via `textstat`).
    * Keyword Extraction (RAKE algorithm via `rake-nltk`).
  * **Input/Output Enhancements**:
    * Support for CSV and JSON file inputs (extracting text from specified columns/keys).
    * Graphical plot generation (`matplotlib`) for word frequencies, sentiment distribution, and word length distribution. Plots are saved to `text_analyzer/analysis_plots/`.
    * Dynamic stop word management (default English, NLTK languages, custom file, or none).
  * **Refactoring**: Significant refactoring for Pythonic best practices, type hinting, and improved structure has been completed.
  * **File Encoding Robustness**: `UnicodeDecodeError` handling improved with `iso-8859-1` in `file_io.py` for text files; UTF-8 used for JSON and custom stop word files.
  * **Module 5C (Initial NLP Library Exploration)**: Step 1 completed (NLTK/spaCy setup and basic exploration).

* **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`) - On `main` branch**:
  * The script is functional for its core purpose of generating Mermaid `gitGraph` syntax for local branches.

* **Documentation & Setup**:
  * `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive.
  * The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for `text_analyzer.py`.
  * Core Memory Bank files are established and being updated.
  * Module 4 and 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module*-*.md`) restructured.

* **Repository State**:
  * The `develop` branch has been successfully merged into the `main` branch.
  * The `main` branch (local and remote `origin/main`) is up-to-date with all completed features.
  * The `develop` branch (local and remote `origin/develop`) has been updated from `main` and is also up-to-date.
  * The `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule is integrated and present on the `main` branch.

## What's Left to Build

*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
    *   **Continue with Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps"**:
        *   Step 2: Experiment with Real-World Data (using the newly enhanced analyzer).
        *   Step 3: Consider if further enhancements are needed or if a new small project is more beneficial for learning.
    *   **Potential Future Enhancements (if desired)**:
        *   Full TF-IDF implementation (currently a placeholder).
        *   Support for other file formats (PDF, DOCX).
        *   More sophisticated automated testing in `run_comprehensive_test()` to cover all new features.
        *   GUI implementation.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
    *   Potential future enhancements as previously listed.

## Current Status

*   **Overall Learning Plan**:
    *   Focus remains on self-directed AI engineering education (LLMs, SAI concept).
    *   Key resources (Raschka, GenAI PDF, Master Curriculum) are integrated into the plan.
*   **Current Learning Focus**: Practical application of NLP concepts via `text_analyzer` enhancements has been completed. Next is to transition to deeper study of "Text representation/early NLP" (GenAI PDF Ch3) and Raschka's Ch2.
*   **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`) - On `main` branch**:
    *   Significantly enhanced with CSV/JSON input, graphical plotting, RAKE keyword extraction, and dynamic stop word management.
    *   Core functionalities and previous advanced NLP features (N-grams, VADER sentiment, spaCy POS/NER, readability) remain operational.
    *   `FIXED_TARGET_FILENAME` in `config.py` is currently `test_plot_sample.txt`.
*   **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`) - On `main` branch**:
    *   Functional.
*   **Repository State**:
    *   `main` branch is stable and up-to-date with all completed features.
    *   `develop` branch is synchronized with `main`.
    *   `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule is integrated.
*   **Deployment**: NumPy incompatibility on Render resolved (`numpy<2.0`).
*   **Memory Bank**: Being updated to reflect recent `text_analyzer` enhancements.

## Known Issues

* **Text Analyzer**:
  * The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` needs significant updates to cover the new features (CSV/JSON input, plotting, RAKE, dynamic stop words).
  * NLTK language stop word selection in `analyzer.py` relies on `cfg.SUPPORTED_NLTK_STOPWORD_LANGUAGES`; a more dynamic check against `stopwords.fileids()` could be more robust if NLTK data path is consistently available.
* **Deployment**:
  * Dependency versions (spaCy, thinc, NumPy) might need future monitoring for compatibility.
* **Git Branch Visualizer**:
  * Existing limitations remain.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

* Initial decision: Establish Cline's Memory Bank system.
* Decision: Create a comprehensive README for Text Analyzer.
* Decision: Systematically update Memory Bank.
* Previous session: Completed Modules 3A-3E for Text Analyzer, initial Module 5C work.
* Earlier in current session:
  * Introduced `branch_visualizer.py`.
  * Updated Memory Bank for Git Branch Visualizer.
  * Restructured Module 4 & 5 `.clinerules` documentation.
  * Completed Text Analyzer Module 4 (A, B, C).
  * Reviewed Module 5 documentation and initiated Module 5C Step 1 (NLTK/spaCy exploration).
  * **Learning Strategy Refinement**: Clarified roles of Raschka, GenAI PDF, Master Curriculum.
* **Current session (continued)**:
    *   **`text_analyzer` Enhancements**:
        *   Added CSV and JSON input support.
        *   Added graphical plotting for word frequencies, sentiment, and word lengths.
        *   Added RAKE keyword extraction.
        *   Added dynamic stop word management.
    *   **Memory Bank Update**: Currently in progress to reflect all the above `text_analyzer` enhancements.
