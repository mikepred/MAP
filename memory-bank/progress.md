# Progress

This document outlines what currently works, what is left to build, the current status of the project, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file is expected to be updated frequently.

## What Works

* **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`) - Now on `main` branch**:
  * **Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture)**: Fully completed.
  * **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)**: Fully completed.
  * **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)**: Fully completed.
  * **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions)**: Fully completed.
  * **Module 3E (Integration & Testing)**: Fully completed. The core text analysis script as defined by Modules 3A-3E is fully functional.
  * **Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed**:
    * Script execution verified.
    * Debugging fundamentals reviewed.
  * **Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) Completed**:
    * Enhancement 1 (Stop Word Removal): `remove_stop_words()` implemented and integrated.
    * Enhancement 2 (User Input for Configuration): `get_user_input_config()` implemented and integrated.
    * Enhancement 3 (Output to File): `save_results_to_file()` implemented and integrated.
  * **Module 4C (Advanced Refinements and Performance) Completed**:
    * `clean_text()` enhanced with an `advanced` flag for URL/email removal.
    * `analyze_word_lengths()` function added and integrated.
    * `time_function()` utility added and overall pipeline timing implemented.
    * `NameError` for `tokenize_text` and other syntax issues resolved.
  * The `text_analyzer.py` script is fully enhanced as per the Module 4 lesson plan and is now integrated into the `main` branch.
  * **Module 5C (Initial Exploration - "Immediate Next Steps" Step 1) - Now on `main` branch**:
    * Reviewed Module 5 documentation.
    * Installed NLTK and spaCy libraries and necessary data/models.
    * Created and executed `text_analyzer/explore_nlp_libraries.py`.

* **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`) - On `main` branch**:
  * The script is functional for its core purpose of generating Mermaid `gitGraph` syntax for local branches.

* **Documentation & Setup**:
  * `text_analyzer/README.md` is comprehensive.
  * The `.clinerules` lesson plan provides a full guide for `text_analyzer.py`.
  * Core Memory Bank files are established and being updated.
  * Module 4 and 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module*-*.md`) restructured.

* **Repository State**:
  * The `develop` branch has been successfully merged into the `main` branch.
  * The `main` branch (local and remote `origin/main`) is up-to-date with all completed features.
  * The `develop` branch (local and remote `origin/develop`) has been updated from `main` and is also up-to-date.
  * The `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule is integrated and present on the `main` branch.

## What's Left to Build

* **Text Analyzer Project (`analyzer.py`)**:
  * Continue with Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps" (Step 2: Experiment with Real-World Data, or Step 3: Build an Enhanced Version).
  * Potential future enhancements (beyond the current lesson plan) as previously listed (e.g., advanced NLP tasks, GUI, different file formats, automated testing).
* **Git Branch Visualizer Project (`branch_visualizer.py`)**:
  * Potential future enhancements as previously listed (e.g., robust error handling, remote branch visualization, alternative layouts, user arguments).

## Current Status

* **Overall Project**: The `main` branch is now the stable, up-to-date representation of the project, incorporating all completed work on the Text Analyzer (including Module 4 enhancements and initial Module 5C exploration) and the functional Git Branch Visualizer.
* **Text Analyzer**: Fully functional as per Modules 1-4, with initial Module 5C exploration completed, all on the `main` branch.
* **Git Branch Visualizer**: Functional on the `main` branch.
* **Memory Bank**: Currently being updated to reflect the `develop` to `main` merge and overall project status.
* **Git Branches**:
  * `main`: Up-to-date locally and on `origin/main`. Contains all merged features.
  * `develop`: Up-to-date locally and on `origin/develop`, synchronized with `main`.

## Known Issues

* **Text Analyzer**:
  * The `run_comprehensive_test()` function in `analyzer.py` could be expanded for more rigorous automated testing.
* **Git Branch Visualizer**:
  * Limitations regarding complex Git histories, performance on very large repos, and main line detection persist as areas for potential improvement.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

* Initial decision: Establish Cline's Memory Bank system.
* Decision: Create a comprehensive README for Text Analyzer.
* Decision: Systematically update Memory Bank.
* Previous session: Completed Modules 3A-3E for Text Analyzer.
* Earlier in current session:
  * Introduced `branch_visualizer.py`.
  * Updated Memory Bank for Git Branch Visualizer.
  * Restructured Module 4 & 5 `.clinerules` documentation.
  * Completed Text Analyzer Module 4 (A, B, C).
  * Reviewed Module 5 documentation and initiated Module 5C Step 1 (NLTK/spaCy exploration).
* **Current session (continued)**:
  * **Successfully merged `develop` branch into `main` branch.** This included resolving merge conflicts in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` and ensuring the `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule was correctly handled and kept.
  * **Pushed updated `main` to `origin/main`.**
  * **Updated `develop` branch from `main` and pushed to `origin/develop`.**
  * Currently updating Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `techContext.md`) to reflect this major integration and current project state.
  * **Resolved markdownlint errors across the project.**
