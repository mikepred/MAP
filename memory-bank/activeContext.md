## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The `text_analyzer.py` script has been implemented up to the completion of **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)** of the lesson plan. This includes:
*   File I/O & Error Handling (Module 3B)
*   Text cleaning and preprocessing functions (`clean_text`, `clean_text_for_words`).
*   Word tokenization and frequency counting functions (`count_words`, `get_unique_words`, `get_word_count_stats`).
*   Sentence analysis functions (`count_sentences`, `analyze_sentences`).
*   A complete text analysis pipeline function (`analyze_text_complete`).

The primary focus is now on implementing **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions)**.

## Recent Changes

*   **Module 3C Completion (Current Session)**: `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now contains the full implementation for Module 3C, including text cleaning, tokenization, frequency counting, sentence analysis, and the main analysis pipeline function. The `main()` function has also been updated to test these new capabilities.
*   **Previous Session Changes (leading to current state)**:
    *   Module 3B was completed.
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` was updated.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` was updated.
*   **Previous Session Changes**:
    *   Project was reset to Module 3A.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` was updated regarding virtual environments.
    *   Core directives in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` were refined.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**
    *   This involves adding functions for:
        *   Advanced statistical analysis (`calculate_readability_stats`, `find_interesting_patterns`).
        *   Professional results formatting and display (`print_header`, `print_section`, `display_general_statistics`, `display_word_analysis`, `display_sentence_analysis`, `display_readability_analysis`, `display_interesting_patterns`).
        *   A complete display system (`display_complete_analysis`, `display_summary`).
        *   Updating the `main()` function to offer display choices.
2.  Proceed with Module 3E (Integration & Testing) sequentially.
3.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan after the basic pipeline (Modules 3A-3E) is functional and tested.
4.  Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to reflect the current state of the project as each module is completed.
