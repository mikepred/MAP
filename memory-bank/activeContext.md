## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The `text_analyzer.py` script has been implemented up to the completion of **Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling)** of the lesson plan. This includes functionalities for validating file paths, reading files with error handling, and getting filenames from user input.

The primary focus is now on implementing **Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline)**.

## Recent Changes

*   **Module 3B Completion**: `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now contains the full implementation for Module 3B.
*   **Memory Bank Update (Current Session)**:
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` updated to reflect that the described architecture is the target, with Module 3B components implemented.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` updated to clarify current vs. planned technologies/dependencies per module.
*   **Previous Session Changes**:
    *   Project was reset to Module 3A.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` was updated regarding virtual environments.
    *   Core directives in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` were refined.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**
    *   This involves adding functions for:
        *   Text cleaning and preprocessing (`clean_text`, `clean_text_for_words`).
        *   Word tokenization and frequency counting (`count_words`, `get_unique_words`, `get_word_count_stats`).
        *   Sentence analysis (`count_sentences`, `analyze_sentences`).
        *   A complete text analysis pipeline function (`analyze_text_complete`).
2.  Proceed with Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) and Module 3E (Integration & Testing) sequentially.
3.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan after the basic pipeline (Modules 3A-3E) is functional and tested.
4.  Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to reflect the current state of the project as each module is completed.
