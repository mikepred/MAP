# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus of the current session is to **update the Cline Memory Bank to incorporate the newly added `branch_visualizer.py` script and its functionality.** This involves reviewing all existing memory bank files and integrating information about the Git Branch Visualizer project component.

## Recent Changes

*   **Memory Bank Update (In Progress, Current Session)**:
    *   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` updated to include core requirements and project goals for the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   `memory-bank/productContext.md` updated to include the problem statement, proposed solution, and user experience goals for the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` updated to include system architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns for the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` updated to include technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns for the Git Branch Visualizer.
*   **New Component Added (Current Session)**:
    *   `branch_visualizer.py`: A Python script that generates a Mermaid `gitGraph` of the local Git repository's branch structure.
    *   `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt`: An example output file generated by `branch_visualizer.py`.
*   **Text Analyzer Project (Previous in Current Session)**:
    *   Module 3E (Integration & Testing) for `text_analyzer.py` was completed. The script now contains the fully integrated code, including a main menu, system testing functionality, and help information.
    *   Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) were updated to reflect Module 3E completion for the text analyzer.
*   **Branching (Previous in Current Session)**:
    *   Created and switched to new branch `module/3D-analysis-display` for the text analyzer's Module 3D work. (Note: The branch for 3E might be the same or a new one, this context needs to be confirmed if relevant for future Git operations).

## Next Steps

1.  **Complete Memory Bank Update for Branch Visualizer (Current Task)**:
    *   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file) to accurately reflect the current task of documenting the branch visualizer. (Currently being done)
    *   Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to include the `branch_visualizer.py` script in "What Works" and its current status.
2.  **Review and Finalize Memory Bank**: Ensure all memory bank files are consistent and accurately reflect the current state of the MAP project, including both the Text Analyzer and the Git Branch Visualizer.
3.  **Commit Changes**: Commit all memory bank updates and the new `branch_visualizer.py` and `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt` files.
4.  **Consider Next Project Phase**: Once documentation is complete, evaluate potential next steps, which might include enhancements to either the Text Analyzer (from Module 4) or the Git Branch Visualizer (e.g., adding features, improving robustness).
