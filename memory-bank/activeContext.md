## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is now on implementing **Module 3E: Integration & Testing** in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`. Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) has been successfully completed and integrated.

## Recent Changes

*   **Module 3D Completed**: Implemented advanced statistical analysis functions (`calculate_readability_stats`, `find_interesting_patterns`), professional display helper functions (`print_header`, `print_section`), specific display functions (`display_general_statistics`, `display_word_analysis`, `display_sentence_analysis`, `display_readability_analysis`, `display_interesting_patterns`), and complete display system functions (`display_complete_analysis`, `display_summary`) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`. The `main` function was updated to integrate these new display options.
*   **Module 3C Completed**: Implemented robust text processing pipeline functions (`clean_text`, `clean_text_for_words`, `count_words`, `get_unique_words`, `get_word_count_stats`, `count_sentences`, `analyze_sentences`, `analyze_text_complete`) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   **Module 3B Completed**: Implemented robust file I/O and error handling functions (`validate_file_path`, `read_file`, `get_filename_from_user`, `load_text_file`) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   **Module 3B Tested**: Successfully tested file reading, error handling for non-existent files, and directory input.
*   **Git Operations**:
    *   Created `develop` branch from `main`.
    *   Created `module/3B-file-io` branch from `develop`.
    *   Committed Module 3B changes to `module/3B-file-io`.
    *   Pushed `module/3B-file-io` to origin.
    *   (Implicitly, `module/3B-file-io` was merged into `develop` and then deleted, as we are now on `module-3c-text-processing-pipeline` which was branched from `develop`.)
    *   Created `module-3c-text-processing-pipeline` branch from `develop`.
*   **Core Directive Refinement**: `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` was refined to include five core mission points, enhancing clarity on proactive partnership, continuous learning, and principled development.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Module 3E (Integration & Testing) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**
    *   This involves integrating all components into a complete application, implementing comprehensive testing procedures, and adding performance optimization.
2.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan after the basic pipeline (Modules 3A-3E) is functional and tested.
3.  Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to reflect the current state of the project as each module is completed.
4.  Commit and push memory bank updates to the current branch.
