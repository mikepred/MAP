        *   Added `analyze_word_lengths()` function and integrated its display into `main()`.
        *   Added `time_function()` utility and implemented overall pipeline timing in `main()`.
        *   Corrected `NameError` for `tokenize_text` and other syntax issues.
    *   The `text_analyzer.py` script is now fully enhanced as per Module 4.
