# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is **updating the Cline Memory Bank** to reflect the successful merge of the `develop` branch (containing completed Text Analyzer Module 4 enhancements and initial Module 5C explorations) into the `main` branch, and the subsequent synchronization of `develop` with `main`.

## Recent Changes

*   **Git Workflow: `develop` Branch Integration into `main` (Current Session)**:
    *   Successfully merged the `develop` branch into the `main` branch.
    *   Resolved merge conflicts in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
    *   Handled the `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule, ensuring it was kept and correctly integrated into `main`.
    *   Pushed the updated `main` branch to the remote repository (`origin/main`).
    *   Updated the local `develop` branch by merging `main` into it.
    *   Pushed the updated `develop` branch to the remote repository (`origin/develop`).
    *   The `main` branch now contains all completed features from the `develop` branch, including Text Analyzer Module 4 enhancements and initial Module 5C work.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 5C Initial Steps (Now on `main`)**:
    *   **Reviewed Module 5**: Completed a comprehensive review of Module 5's overview, navigation, and sub-modules (5A, 5B, 5C).
    *   **Explored Advanced NLP Libraries (Step 1 of Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps")**:
        *   Installed NLTK and spaCy libraries.
        *   Downloaded NLTK data packages (`punkt`, `stopwords`, `punkt_tab`).
        *   Downloaded spaCy English language model (`en_core_web_sm`).
        *   Created `text_analyzer/explore_nlp_libraries.py` to demonstrate basic NLTK and spaCy functionalities.
        *   Successfully executed `explore_nlp_libraries.py`.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 4 Development (Now on `main`)**:
    *   **Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed**.
    *   **Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) Completed** (Stop Word Removal, User Input Config, Output to File).
    *   **Module 4C (Advanced Refinements and Performance) Completed** (Advanced Cleaning, Word Length Analysis, Performance Timing).
    *   The `text_analyzer.py` script is fully enhanced as per Module 4 and these enhancements are now part of the `main` branch.

*   **Memory Bank Documentation Restructuring (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   Module 4 documentation (`.clinerules/module4-*.md`) was restructured.
    *   Module 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module5-*.md`) was restructured.

*   **Git Branch Visualizer (Completed Earlier in Session, on `main`)**:
    *   `branch_visualizer.py` script created and functional.
    *   Memory bank files were updated to include the Git Branch Visualizer project.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 3E Completion (Completed Earlier in Session, on `main`)**:
    *   Module 3E (Integration & Testing) for `text_analyzer.py` was completed.

## Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Update (Current Task)**:
    *   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file) - Completed.
    *   Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the `develop` to `main` merge and current project status.
    *   Update `memory-bank/techContext.md` (Git submodule note) - Completed.
    *   Review other memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`) for any minor consistency updates if needed (already reviewed, no changes needed for these two).
2.  **Commit Memory Bank Updates**:
    *   Commit all changes made to the memory bank files.
3.  **Continue with Text Analyzer - Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps" (on `main` or a new feature branch)**:
    *   Decide on and proceed with Step 2 (Experiment with Real-World Data) or Step 3 (Build an Enhanced Version of Your Project / New Small Project) from Module 5C.
4.  **Review Overall Project Status**:
    *   Confirm all objectives for the Text Analyzer lesson plan (Modules 1-4, now integrated into `main`) are met.
    *   Assess status of Git Branch Visualizer.
