# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is **updating the Cline Memory Bank** to document the recently completed refactorings of `analyzer.py` and to list pending improvement tasks based on a code review.

## Recent Changes

* **Git Workflow: `develop` Branch Integration into `main` (Previous Major Step)**:
  * Successfully merged the `develop` branch into the `main` branch.
  * Resolved merge conflicts in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
  * Handled the `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule, ensuring it was kept and correctly integrated into `main`.
  * Pushed the updated `main` branch to the remote repository (`origin/main`).
  * Updated the local `develop` branch by merging `main` into it.
  * Pushed the updated `develop` branch to the remote repository (`origin/develop`).
  * The `main` branch now contains all completed features from the `develop` branch, including Text Analyzer Module 4 enhancements and initial Module 5C work.

* **Text Analyzer Project - Module 5C Initial Steps (Now on `main`)**:
  * **Reviewed Module 5**: Completed a comprehensive review of Module 5's overview, navigation, and sub-modules (5A, 5B, 5C).
  * **Explored Advanced NLP Libraries (Step 1 of Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps")**:
    * Installed NLTK and spaCy libraries.
    * Downloaded NLTK data packages (`punkt`, `stopwords`, `punkt_tab`).
    * Downloaded spaCy English language model (`en_core_web_sm`).
    * Created `text_analyzer/explore_nlp_libraries.py` to demonstrate basic NLTK and spaCy functionalities.
    * Successfully executed `explore_nlp_libraries.py`.
    * **Resolved markdownlint errors across the project.**

* **Text Analyzer Project - Module 4 Development (Now on `main`)**:
  * **Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed**.
  * **Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) Completed** (Stop Word Removal, User Input Config, Output to File).
  * **Module 4C (Advanced Refinements and Performance) Completed** (Advanced Cleaning, Word Length Analysis, Performance Timing).
  * The `text_analyzer.py` script is fully enhanced as per Module 4 and these enhancements are now part of the `main` branch.

* **Refactoring of `analyzer.py` (Completed in Current Session)**:
  * Corrected `get_user_input_config()` docstring/type hint.
  * Extracted `_handle_analyze_file_option()` from `main()`.
  * Centralized readability/pattern calculation in `analyze_text_complete()`.
  * Removed `get_unique_words()`.
  * Added "Analyze Custom Text File" menu option to `main()`.
  * Pre-compiled regex patterns.
  * Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect these refactorings.

* **Review of Pending Refactorings (Current Session)**:
  * Reviewed earlier recommendations for `analyzer.py`.
  * Identified a list of pending improvements (e.g., file splitting, further `main()` refactoring, testing enhancements).

* **Memory Bank Documentation Restructuring (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
  * Module 4 documentation (`.clinerules/module4-*.md`) was restructured.
  * Module 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module5-*.md`) was restructured.

* **Git Branch Visualizer (Completed Earlier in Session, on `main`)**:
  * `branch_visualizer.py` script created and functional.
  * Memory bank files were updated to include the Git Branch Visualizer project.

* **Text Analyzer Project - Module 3E Completion (Completed Earlier in Session, on `main`)**:
  * Module 3E (Integration & Testing) for `text_analyzer.py` was completed.

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Memory Bank Update (Current Task)**:
    * Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file) - This update.
    * Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to list pending refactoring tasks.
    * Review other memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) for any minor consistency updates if needed.

2. **Commit Memory Bank Updates**:

    * Commit all changes made to the memory bank files.

3. **Continue with Text Analyzer - Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps" (on `main` or a new feature branch)**:

    * Decide on and proceed with Step 2 (Experiment with Real-World Data) or Step 3 (Build an Enhanced Version of Your Project / New Small Project) from Module 5C.

4. **Review Overall Project Status**:

    * Confirm all objectives for the Text Analyzer lesson plan (Modules 1-4, now integrated into `main`) are met.
    * Assess status of Git Branch Visualizer.
