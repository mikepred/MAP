# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is **understanding and integrating new learning resources** into the self-directed AI engineering education plan. This involves:
*   Reviewing Sebastian Raschka's "Build an LLM (From Scratch)" book/repository.
*   Reviewing the "Generative AI with Python and PyTorch, Second Edition" PDF (referred to as "GenAI PDF"), particularly its chapters on Deep Learning fundamentals, Text Representation/Early NLP (Ch 3), Transformers (Ch 4), LLM Foundations (Ch 5), Open-Source LLMs (Ch 6), Prompt Engineering (Ch 7), LLM Tooling (Ch 8), Optimization (Ch 9), and Emerging Applications (Ch 10).
*   Synthesizing these resources with the existing "AI Engineering Master Curriculum" (from `This comprehensive lesson plan takes a l.md`) which serves as an inspirational reference.
*   Clarifying how these resources support the conceptual learning framework of "SAI".
*   Updating the Cline Memory Bank to reflect this expanded learning strategy.

**Current Learning Phase:** Text representation/early NLP, with a focus on Chapter 3 of the "GenAI PDF" as it relates to foundational concepts for Raschka's book.

## Recent Changes

*   **Learning Strategy Refinement (Current Session):**
    *   Reviewed and discussed the "AI Engineering Master Curriculum" (from `This comprehensive lesson plan takes a l.md`), clarifying its role as an inspirational reference.
    *   Reviewed Sebastian Raschka's "Build an LLM (From Scratch)" (book/repo), establishing it as the primary technical guide for LLM implementation.
    *   Reviewed "Generative AI with Python and PyTorch, Second Edition" PDF (GenAI PDF), establishing it as a comprehensive theoretical and practical textbook. Chapter 3 (Text Representation/Early NLP) identified as immediately relevant. Chapters 7-11 (Prompt Engineering, LLM Tooling, Optimization, etc.) identified as important for later learning stages.
    *   Affirmed the `text_analyzer` project's role as a foundational practical exercise.
    *   Solidified "SAI" as the conceptual learning framework.
    *   Updated `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` and `memory-bank/productContext.md` to reflect this integrated learning strategy.
    *   Completed updates to `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file), `memory-bank/progress.md`, and `memory-bank/techContext.md` to reflect the refined learning strategy and ensure consistency.

*   **Previous Work (Still Relevant Context):**
    *   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 5C Initial Steps Completed**.
    *   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 4 Development Completed**.
    *   **Refactoring of `analyzer.py` for Pythonic best practices**.
    *   **Git Branch Visualizer created and functional**.

## Pending Tasks & Next Steps

1.  **Commit Memory Bank Updates**:
    *   Commit all changes made to the memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

2.  **Continue Learning (Self-Directed AI Engineering Education)**:
    *   **Current Focus:** "Text representation/early NLP."
        *   Study Chapter 3 of the "GenAI PDF."
        *   Relate concepts to the `text_analyzer` project.
        *   Prepare for/begin Chapter 2 of Raschka's "Build an LLM (From Scratch)."
    *   **Ongoing:** Populate MCP Knowledge Graph with learned concepts.

3.  **Review `text_analyzer` Project Status (Lower Priority for now)**:
    *   Assess if further work on Module 5C for `text_analyzer` is desired before deeper engagement with Raschka's book, or if it should be paused.
    *   Address pending refactorings/improvements for `text_analyzer.py` as time permits or if they become relevant to current learning.
