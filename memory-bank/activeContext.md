## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is now on implementing **Module 3D: Analysis & Display Functions** in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`. Module 3C (Text Processing Pipeline) has been successfully completed and integrated into the `module-3c-text-processing-pipeline` branch.

## Recent Changes

*   **Module 3B Completed**: Implemented robust file I/O and error handling functions (`validate_file_path`, `read_file`, `get_filename_from_user`, `load_text_file`) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
*   **Module 3B Tested**: Successfully tested file reading, error handling for non-existent files, and directory input.
*   **Git Operations**:
    *   Created `develop` branch from `main`.
    *   Created `module/3B-file-io` branch from `develop`.
    *   Committed Module 3B changes to `module/3B-file-io`.
    *   Pushed `module/3B-file-io` to origin.
    *   (Implicitly, `module/3B-file-io` was merged into `develop` and then deleted, as we are now on `module-3c-text-processing-pipeline` which was branched from `develop`.)
    *   Created `module-3c-text-processing-pipeline` branch from `develop`.
*   **Core Directive Refinement**: `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` was refined to include five core mission points, enhancing clarity on proactive partnership, continuous learning, and principled development.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**
    *   This involves adding functions for advanced statistical analysis, professional results formatting, and user-friendly display.
2.  Proceed with Module 3E sequentially, branching from `develop` for each.
3.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan after the basic pipeline (Modules 3A-3E) is functional and tested.
4.  Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to reflect the current state of the project as each module is completed.
5.  Commit and push memory bank updates to the current branch.
