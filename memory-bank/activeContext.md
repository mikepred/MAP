## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on ensuring the project's documentation (Memory Bank files and `README.md`) is complete, accurate, and aligned with the project goals and the `.clinerules` lesson plan. This involves:

*   Systematically reviewing and updating all core Memory Bank files.
*   Ensuring the `text_analyzer/README.md` provides a clear, engaging, and educational introduction to the project.

## Recent Changes

*   Successfully collaborated with the user to create a comprehensive and educationally focused `text_analyzer/README.md`. This involved incorporating user feedback, adding visual elements, a troubleshooting table, and success criteria.
*   Completed the review of all six core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps

1.  Finalize the Memory Bank updates by:
    *   Proposing the content for the remaining Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`).
    *   Applying the approved updates to these files using the `write_to_file` tool.
2.  Once the Memory Bank is fully updated, await further instructions from the user regarding the `text_analyzer` project itself. This may involve:
    *   Code review of the `analyzer.py` script (once it's implemented).
    *   Implementing enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output).
    *   Testing the script with different text sources.
