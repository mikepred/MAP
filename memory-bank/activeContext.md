# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is **updating the Cline Memory Bank** to reflect the latest project status, including the successful `develop` to `main` branch merge and recent `analyzer.py` refactorings.

## Recent Changes

*   **Git Workflow: `develop` Branch Integrated into `main`**:
    *   Successfully merged the `develop` branch into the `main` branch.
    *   Resolved merge conflicts in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
    *   Handled the `LLMs-from-scratch` Git submodule, ensuring it was kept and correctly integrated into `main`.
    *   Pushed the updated `main` branch to the remote repository (`origin/main`).
    *   Updated the local `develop` branch by merging `main` into it.
    *   Pushed the updated `develop` branch to the remote repository (`origin/develop`).
    *   The `main` branch now contains all completed features from the `develop` branch, including Text Analyzer Module 4 enhancements and initial Module 5C work.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 5C Initial Steps**:
    *   Reviewed Module 5's overview, navigation, and sub-modules (5A, 5B, 5C).
    *   **Explored Advanced NLP Libraries (Step 1 of Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps")**:
        *   Installed NLTK and spaCy libraries.
        *   Downloaded NLTK data packages (`punkt`, `stopwords`, `punkt_tab`).
        *   Downloaded spaCy English language model (`en_core_web_sm`).
        *   Created `text_analyzer/explore_nlp_libraries.py` to demonstrate basic NLTK and spaCy functionalities.
        *   Successfully executed `explore_nlp_libraries.py`.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 4 Development**:
    *   Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed.
    *   Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) Completed (Stop Word Removal, User Input Config, Output to File).
    *   Module 4C (Advanced Refinements and Performance) Completed (Advanced Cleaning, Word Length Analysis, Performance Timing).
    *   The `text_analyzer.py` script is fully enhanced as per Module 4 and these enhancements are now part of the `main` branch.

*   **Refactoring of `analyzer.py`**:
    *   Applied type hints, defined module-level constants, standardized path handling with `pathlib`.
    *   Consolidated text cleaning functions.
    *   Centralized all analysis logic within `analyze_text_complete()`.
    *   Refactored `main()` for better menu handling, including adding a custom file analysis option.
    *   Removed redundant functions (e.g., `get_unique_words()`).
    *   Pre-compiled regular expressions for efficiency.

*   **Memory Bank Documentation Restructuring**:
    *   Module 4 documentation (`.clinerules/module4-*.md`) was restructured into sub-modules.
    *   Module 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module5-*.md`) was restructured into sub-modules.

*   **Git Branch Visualizer**:
    *   `branch_visualizer.py` script created and functional.
    *   Memory bank files were updated to include the Git Branch Visualizer project.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 3E Completion**:
    *   Module 3E (Integration & Testing) for `text_analyzer.py` was completed.

*   **Resolved markdownlint errors across the project.**

## Pending Tasks & Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Update (Current Task)**:
    *   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file) - *This update is in progress.*
    *   Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the latest status and remove completed refactoring items.
    *   Review other memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) for any minor consistency updates.

2.  **Commit Memory Bank Updates**:
    *   Commit all changes made to the memory bank files.

3.  **Continue with Text Analyzer - Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps" (on `main` or a new feature branch)**:
    *   Decide on and proceed with Step 2 (Experiment with Real-World Data) or Step 3 (Build an Enhanced Version of Your Project / New Small Project) from Module 5C.

4.  **Review Overall Project Status**:
    *   Confirm all objectives for the Text Analyzer lesson plan (Modules 1-4, now integrated into `main`) are met.
    *   Assess status of Git Branch Visualizer.

5.  **Text Analyzer Project - Pending Refactorings/Improvements**:
    *   **Major Structural:**
        *   Split `analyzer.py` into multiple, more focused Python modules (e.g., `file_utils.py`, `text_processing.py`, `analysis_utils.py`, `display_utils.py`).
        *   Further refactor `main()`: Extract logic for the "Analyze Custom Text File" menu option into its own helper function.
    *   **Functional/Clarity:**
        *   Consider more descriptive names for `clean_text_for_sentence_analysis` and `clean_text` (if `clean_text_for_sentence_analysis` is still present, otherwise ensure `clean_text` is appropriately named for its consolidated role).
        *   Simplify `get_filename_from_user()` path resolution logic.
    *   **Robustness/Testing:**
        *   Improve `run_comprehensive_test()` with specific assertions against known inputs/outputs.
        *   (Long-term) Consider transitioning to a formal testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).
        *   Implement more specific exception handling where generic `except Exception` is used.
    *   **Minor/Configurability:**
        *   Make `time_function` output (internal print) configurable or return duration for conditional printing.
        *   Parameterize or use constants for hardcoded numerical values in functions like `get_word_count_stats` (e.g., `most_common(5)`) and `find_interesting_patterns` (slice limits).
