## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

**Module 3E (Integration & Testing) is complete.** The `text_analyzer.py` script now contains the fully integrated code, including a main menu, system testing functionality, and help information, bringing together all components from Modules 3A through 3D.

## Recent Changes

*   **Module 3E Completion (Current Session)**: `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` has been updated with the complete integrated code as per Module 3E documentation. This includes the final main menu, system testing function (`run_comprehensive_test()`), and help information.
*   **Module 3D Completion (Previous in Current Session)**: `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now contains the full implementation for Module 3D. This includes functions for advanced statistical analysis (`calculate_readability_stats`, `find_interesting_patterns`), professional results formatting (`print_header`, `print_section`, `display_general_statistics`, etc.), a complete display system (`display_complete_analysis`, `display_summary`), and an updated `main()` function offering display choices. The script was tested successfully.
*   **Branch Creation (Previous in Current Session)**: Created and switched to new branch `module/3D-analysis-display`.
*   **Previous Work (Previous in Current Session)**:
    *   Module 3C was completed and `analyzer.py` updated.
    *   Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) were updated for Module 3C.
    *   Module 3C changes were committed and pushed to `origin/module/3C-text-pipeline`.
*   **Previous Session Changes (leading to current state)**:
    *   Module 3B was completed.
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` was updated.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` was updated.
*   **Previous Session Changes**:
    *   Project was reset to Module 3A.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` was updated regarding virtual environments.
    *   Core directives in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` were refined.

## Next Steps

1.  Update Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect Module 3E completion (currently in progress).
2.  Commit all changes for Module 3E.
3.  Push the current branch (`module/3D-analysis-display` or a new one for 3E) to origin.
4.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan now that the basic pipeline (Modules 3A-3E) is functional and tested.
