## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The `text_analyzer.py` script has been implemented up to the completion of **Module 3D (Analysis & Display Functions)** of the lesson plan. This includes:
*   File I/O & Error Handling (Module 3B).
*   Text Processing Pipeline (Module 3C): Text cleaning, tokenization, frequency counting, sentence analysis, and the main analysis pipeline function.
*   Analysis & Display Functions (Module 3D): Advanced statistical analysis, professional results formatting, and a complete display system with user choices.

The primary focus is now on implementing **Module 3E (Integration & Testing)**.

## Recent Changes

*   **Module 3D Completion (Current Session)**: `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` now contains the full implementation for Module 3D. This includes functions for advanced statistical analysis (`calculate_readability_stats`, `find_interesting_patterns`), professional results formatting (`print_header`, `print_section`, `display_general_statistics`, etc.), a complete display system (`display_complete_analysis`, `display_summary`), and an updated `main()` function offering display choices. The script was tested successfully.
*   **Branch Creation (Current Session)**: Created and switched to new branch `module/3D-analysis-display`.
*   **Previous Work (Current Session)**:
    *   Module 3C was completed and `analyzer.py` updated.
    *   Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) were updated for Module 3C.
    *   Module 3C changes were committed and pushed to `origin/module/3C-text-pipeline`.
*   **Previous Session Changes (leading to current state)**:
    *   Module 3B was completed.
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` was updated.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` was updated.
*   **Previous Session Changes**:
    *   Project was reset to Module 3A.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` was updated regarding virtual environments.
    *   Core directives in `../../Cline/Rules/00-primary-directive.md` were refined.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Module 3E (Integration & Testing) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**
    *   This involves integrating all components into a final application structure.
    *   Adding comprehensive testing procedures (e.g., a `run_comprehensive_test()` function).
    *   Finalizing the `main()` function to include a menu for analysis or testing.
    *   Ensuring robust error handling throughout the application.
2.  After Module 3E is complete and tested:
    *   Update Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
    *   Commit all changes for Module 3D and 3E.
    *   Push the `module/3D-analysis-display` branch to origin.
3.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan after the basic pipeline (Modules 3A-3E) is functional and tested.
