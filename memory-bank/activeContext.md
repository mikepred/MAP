# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus of the current session is to **update the Cline Memory Bank to reflect the restructuring of both the Module 4 and Module 5 lesson plan documentation.** This involves reviewing and updating relevant memory bank files, particularly this file (`activeContext.md`) and `progress.md`.

## Recent Changes

*   **Module 4 Documentation Restructuring (Current Session)**:
    *   Reviewed `.clinerules/module4-testing.md`.
    *   Restructured Module 4 documentation into new, more focused files:
        *   `.clinerules/module4-overview.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module4A-testing-debugging.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module4B-core-enhancements.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module4C-advanced-refinements.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module4-navigation.md`
*   **Module 5 Documentation Restructuring (Current Session)**:
    *   Reviewed `.clinerules/module5-llm-connections.md`.
    *   Restructured Module 5 documentation into new, more focused files:
        *   `.clinerules/module5-overview.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module5A-foundations-llm-parallels.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module5B-applications-ai-landscape.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module5C-next-steps-learning-path.md`
        *   `.clinerules/module5-navigation.md`
*   **Memory Bank Update for Branch Visualizer (Completed in Current Session)**:
    *   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` updated to include core requirements and project goals for the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   `memory-bank/productContext.md` updated to include the problem statement, proposed solution, and user experience goals for the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` updated to include system architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns for the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   `memory-bank/techContext.md` updated to include technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns for the Git Branch Visualizer.
    *   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` was updated to reflect the branch visualizer work.
    *   `memory-bank/progress.md` was updated to include the `branch_visualizer.py` script.
*   **New Component Added (Current Session)**:
    *   `branch_visualizer.py`: A Python script that generates a Mermaid `gitGraph` of the local Git repository's branch structure.
    *   `branch_visualization.mermaid.txt`: An example output file generated by `branch_visualizer.py`.
*   **Text Analyzer Project (Previous in Current Session)**:
    *   Module 3E (Integration & Testing) for `text_analyzer.py` was completed. The script now contains the fully integrated code, including a main menu, system testing functionality, and help information.
    *   Memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) were updated to reflect Module 3E completion for the text analyzer.
*   **Branching (Previous in Current Session)**:
    *   Created and switched to new branch `module/3D-analysis-display` for the text analyzer's Module 3D work.

## Next Steps

1.  **Complete Memory Bank Update for Module 4 and Module 5 Restructuring (Current Task)**:
    *   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file) to accurately reflect the current task. (Currently being done)
    *   Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the Module 4 and Module 5 documentation restructuring.
2.  **Review and Finalize Memory Bank**: Ensure all memory bank files are consistent and accurately reflect the current state of the MAP project.
3.  **Commit Changes**: Commit all memory bank updates and the new Module 4 and Module 5 documentation files.
4.  **Consider Next Project Phase**: Evaluate potential next steps, which might include enhancements to the Text Analyzer (from the newly structured Module 4 and informed by Module 5) or the Git Branch Visualizer.
