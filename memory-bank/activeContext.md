## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The project has been reset. The primary focus is now on re-implementing the `text_analyzer.py` script starting from Module 3A of the lesson plan. Currently, Module 3A is complete. The next step is to implement Module 3B.

## Recent Changes

*   **Project Reset**: `text_analyzer/analyzer.py` has been reset to its initial state as defined in Module 3A (Project Setup & Architecture).
*   Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` to better reflect the lesson plan's recommendation for using a virtual environment.
*   `memory-bank/progress.md` will be updated to reflect this reset.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement Module 3B (File I/O & Error Handling) in `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.**
    *   This involves adding functions for robust file reading, path validation, and user input handling.
2.  Proceed with Module 3C, 3D, and 3E sequentially.
3.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan after the basic pipeline (Modules 3A-3E) is functional and tested.
4.  Update `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to reflect the current state of the project as each module is completed.
