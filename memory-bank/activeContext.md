# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus of the current session is **exploring advanced NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy) as outlined in Module 5C, and updating the Cline Memory Bank.**

## Recent Changes

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 5C Initial Steps (Current Session)**:
    *   **Reviewed Module 5**: Completed a comprehensive review of Module 5's overview, navigation, and sub-modules (5A, 5B, 5C).
    *   **Explored Advanced NLP Libraries (Step 1 of Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps")**:
        *   Installed NLTK and spaCy libraries.
        *   Downloaded NLTK data packages (`punkt`, `stopwords`, `punkt_tab`).
        *   Downloaded spaCy English language model (`en_core_web_sm`).
        *   Created `text_analyzer/explore_nlp_libraries.py` to demonstrate basic NLTK and spaCy functionalities (tokenization, stop-word removal, NER, POS tagging).
        *   Successfully executed `explore_nlp_libraries.py`.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 4 Development (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   **Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed**:
        *   Verified `analyzer.py` (from Module 3E) execution.
        *   Reviewed debugging fundamentals.
    *   **Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) Completed**:
        *   Enhancement 1 (Stop Word Removal): Implemented `remove_stop_words()`, integrated into `count_words()` and `analyze_text_complete()`.
        *   Enhancement 2 (User Input for Configuration): Implemented `get_user_input_config()` for filepath, top N words, and stop word toggle. Integrated into `main()`.
        *   Enhancement 3 (Output to File): Implemented `save_results_to_file()`, integrated user prompt into `main()`.
    *   **Module 4C (Advanced Refinements and Performance) Completed**:
        *   Enhanced `clean_text()` with an `advanced` flag for URL/email removal.
        *   Added `analyze_word_lengths()` function and integrated its display into `main()`.
        *   Added `time_function()` utility and implemented overall pipeline timing in `main()`.
        *   Corrected `NameError` for `tokenize_text` and other syntax issues.
    *   The `text_analyzer.py` script is now fully enhanced as per Module 4.

*   **Memory Bank Documentation Restructuring (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   Module 4 documentation (`.clinerules/module4-*.md`) was restructured.
    *   Module 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module5-*.md`) was restructured.

*   **Git Branch Visualizer (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   `branch_visualizer.py` script created and functional.
    *   Memory bank files were updated to include the Git Branch Visualizer project.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 3E Completion (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   Module 3E (Integration & Testing) for `text_analyzer.py` was completed.

## Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Update (Current Task)**:
    *   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file) - In progress.
    *   Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect Module 5 exploration.
    *   Review other memory bank files for any minor consistency updates if needed.
2.  **Continue with Module 5C "Immediate Next Steps"**:
    *   Decide on and proceed with Step 2 (Experiment with Real-World Data) or Step 3 (Build an Enhanced Version of Your Project / New Small Project) from Module 5C.
3.  **Review Text Analyzer Project Completion**:
    *   Confirm all objectives for the Text Analyzer lesson plan (Modules 1-4) are met.
4.  **Commit Changes**:
    *   Commit all Module 5 exploration work and memory bank updates.
