## Active Context: Text Analyzer Project

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps specifically for the `text_analyzer` project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is now on implementing the core text processing pipeline as outlined in Module 3 of the lesson plan. This involves:

*   Creating the `analyzer.py` script with the functions for reading, cleaning, tokenizing, counting, and displaying word frequencies.
*   Ensuring the script adheres to best practices for code style, error handling, and documentation.

## Recent Changes

*   Successfully enhanced `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` with additional best practices, guidelines, and a table of contents with links to subsections.
*   Pushed the updated `.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md` file to the GitHub repository (`mikepred/MAP`, branch `main`).

## Next Steps

1. Implement the core text processing pipeline in `analyzer.py` as described in Module 3 of the lesson plan.
2.  Test the `analyzer.py` script with the provided `sample.txt` file and address any debugging issues.
3.  Consider enhancements from Module 4 of the lesson plan (e.g., stop word removal, user input, file output) after the basic pipeline is functional.
4.  Update the `progress.md` file to reflect the current state of the project.
