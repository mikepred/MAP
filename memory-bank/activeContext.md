# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the MAP project.

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus of the current session is **implementing Module 4B enhancements for the `text_analyzer.py` script.**
*   Enhancement 1 (Stop Word Removal) is complete and tested.
*   Currently preparing to implement Enhancement 2 (User Input for Configuration).
*   This also involves updating the Cline Memory Bank to reflect this progress.

## Recent Changes

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 4 Development (Current Session)**:
    *   Started Module 4 ("Testing, Refinement, and Enhancements").
    *   **Module 4A (Testing and Debugging Fundamentals) Completed**:
        *   Verified `analyzer.py` (from Module 3E) execution.
        *   Updated `text_analyzer/sample.txt` to align with Module 4A test data.
        *   Reviewed debugging fundamentals and common issues.
    *   **Module 4B (Core Script Enhancements) - Enhancement 1 Implemented**:
        *   Added `remove_stop_words()` function to `text_analyzer/analyzer.py`.
        *   Modified `count_words()` to optionally use stop word removal.
        *   Modified `analyze_text_complete()` to handle the stop word flag and pass the full `word_counts` object (as `full_word_counts_obj`) for detailed display.
        *   Updated `main()` to enable stop word removal by default (hardcoded `True` for now) and provide informational print.
        *   Successfully tested `analyzer.py` with stop word removal active.

*   **Memory Bank Documentation Restructuring (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   Module 4 documentation (`.clinerules/module4-*.md`) was restructured.
    *   Module 5 documentation (`.clinerules/module5-*.md`) was restructured.

*   **Git Branch Visualizer (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   `branch_visualizer.py` script created and functional.
    *   Memory bank files were updated to include the Git Branch Visualizer project.

*   **Text Analyzer Project - Module 3E Completion (Completed Earlier in Session)**:
    *   Module 3E (Integration & Testing) for `text_analyzer.py` was completed.

## Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank Update (Current Task)**:
    *   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file). (This update is being applied now)
    *   Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
    *   Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (Completed in the previous step).
2.  **Continue with Module 4B for `text_analyzer.py`**:
    *   Implement Enhancement 2: User Input for Configuration (making stop word removal, input file, and number of top words configurable by the user at runtime).
3.  **Continue with Module 4B for `text_analyzer.py`**:
    *   Implement Enhancement 3: Output to File (allowing users to save analysis results).
4.  **Proceed to Module 4C**:
    *   Implement advanced refinements and performance considerations for `text_analyzer.py`.
5.  **Commit Changes**:
    *   Commit all Module 4B enhancements and memory bank updates for `text_analyzer.py`.
