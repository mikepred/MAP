# Product Context

This document outlines the "why" behind the project. It details the problems the project aims to solve, how it should function from a user's perspective, and the overall user experience goals.

## Problem Statement

Many learners find it challenging to grasp the foundational concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) without a practical, hands-on project. They need a simple, accessible entry point to understand how text data is processed and analyzed before being used in more complex AI systems.

## Proposed Solution

The `text_analyzer` project provides a Python script (`analyzer.py`) that implements a basic text analysis pipeline. This pipeline demonstrates the core steps involved in preparing text data for NLP tasks: reading text from a file, cleaning and normalizing the text, tokenizing it into individual words, counting word frequencies, and displaying the most common words.

By building and running this script, learners gain practical experience with these fundamental concepts.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Accessibility**: The project should be easy to understand and run, even for beginners with limited Python experience.
*   **Educational Value**: The project should clearly illustrate the core concepts of text processing and their relevance to NLP and LLMs.
*   **Engagement**: The project should be engaging and encourage learners to experiment with different text sources and enhancements.
*   **Clarity**: The project's output (the list of most common words) should be clear, informative, and easy to interpret.
*   **Foundation**: The project should provide a solid foundation for further exploration of NLP and LLM topics.
