## Text Analyzer Project

### Problem Statement

Many learners find it challenging to grasp the foundational concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) without a practical, hands-on project. Initially conceived as a simple entry point, the `text_analyzer` now also addresses the need for an evolving, intermediate-level educational tool. This tool not only demonstrates increasingly complex text processing and analysis techniques but also serves as a tangible record of the learner's journey and applied skills development. It helps bridge the gap between basic understanding and the more advanced concepts encountered in self-directed AI engineering education.

### Proposed Solution

The `text_analyzer` project provides a Python script (`analyzer.py`) that implements a comprehensive text analysis pipeline. This pipeline demonstrates a wide range of steps involved in preparing and analyzing text data for NLP tasks:
*   Reading text from various file formats (plain text, CSV, JSON).
*   Cleaning and normalizing the text.
*   Tokenizing text into individual words.
*   Dynamic stop word management (default, NLTK languages, custom lists, or none).
*   Counting word frequencies.
*   N-gram analysis (bigrams, trigrams).
*   Sentence structure analysis.
*   Readability assessment using multiple standard indices.
*   Sentiment analysis using VADER.
*   Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and lexical density calculation using spaCy.
*   Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy.
*   Keyword extraction using RAKE.
*   Pattern detection (including user-defined regex).
*   Displaying results in a user-friendly console format, including optional graphical plots for key metrics (word frequencies, sentiment, word lengths).

By using and extending this script, learners gain practical experience with these fundamental and more advanced NLP concepts.

### User Experience Goals (Text Analyzer)

* **Accessibility**: The project should be relatively easy to run, with clear prompts for configuration.
* **Educational Value**: The project clearly illustrates a broad range of text processing and analysis techniques, evolving from foundational to intermediate levels, and demonstrates their relevance to NLP and LLMs. It serves as a practical application ground for concepts learned.
* **Engagement**: The project should be engaging, allowing users to analyze various text sources with multiple configuration options and see diverse outputs, including visualizations.
* **Clarity**: The project's output should be comprehensive, well-structured, and easy to interpret, including both textual reports and graphical plots.
* **Foundation & Beyond**: The project provides a solid foundation and extends into intermediate NLP tasks, bridging the gap to more advanced topics in resources like Raschka's "Build an LLM (From Scratch)" and the "GenAI PDF."
* **Learning Journey Tracker**: The progressive enhancement of the `text_analyzer` itself acts as a practical portfolio, showcasing the learner's growing skills and understanding in applied NLP and software development.
* **Flexibility**: Users should have control over aspects like stop word lists, input file types, and output display.
