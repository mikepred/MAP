## Project: Python for Text Processing - A Foundation for LLMs (from .clinerules)

This project brief is derived from the `.clinerules` found in the `c:/Users/miken/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/MAP/.clinerules/` directory, specifically the lesson plan for creating a Python text processing script.

### Project Goal (from `.clinerules/lesson-plan.md`)
Write a Python script that reads a text file, cleans it, tokenizes it, counts word frequencies, displays the most common words, and is structured with functions.

### Target Audience (from `.clinerules/lesson-plan.md`)
Adventurous learners familiar with Python basics (variables, loops, basic data structures, writing simple functions) but looking to apply these skills to a practical project and understand foundational text processing techniques.

### Overall Learning Objective (from `.clinerules/lesson-plan.md`)
To build a functional text processing pipeline in Python and understand how each component (reading, cleaning, tokenizing, counting) contributes to analyzing text data, drawing parallels to the initial stages of data preparation for LLMs.

### Reference to `llms-from-scratch` (from `.clinerules/lesson-plan.md`)
This project introduces core ideas like tokenization and data processing pipelines, which are fundamental to building LLMs. It's positioned as a foundational step ("learning the ABCs") before tackling more complex LLM concepts like those in the `llms-from-scratch` repository (e.g., `ch02/01_main-chapter-code/ch02.ipynb` or `ch02/05_bpe-from-scratch/bpe-from-scratch.ipynb`).

### Module Structure (from `.clinerules/lesson-plan.md`)
The lesson plan is divided into the following modules:

*   **Module 1: Introduction & Setting the Stage** (`.clinerules/module1-introduction.md`)
    *   Overview of text processing, project's role, connection to LLMs, and environment setup.
    *   Includes creating `text_analyzer/` directory with `analyzer.py`, `sample.txt`, and `README.md`.
*   **Module 2: Core Python Concepts for Text Processing** (`.clinerules/module2-python-concepts.md`)
    *   Covers file handling, text cleaning (lowercase, punctuation removal), tokenization (`.split()`), frequency counting (`collections.Counter`), displaying results, and modular design with functions.
*   **Module 3: Building the Script - Step-by-Step** (`.clinerules/module3-building-script.md`)
    *   Provides complete implementations for functions: `read_file()`, `clean_text()`, `tokenize_text()`, `count_frequencies()`, `display_most_common()`, and the main execution block.
*   **Module 4: Testing and Refinement** (`.clinerules/module4-testing.md`)
    *   Guides through running the script, debugging common issues (file not found, empty output, encoding errors), and suggests enhancements (stop word removal, user input, file output, advanced cleaning, word length analysis, performance timing).
*   **Module 5: Connecting to the Bigger World of LLMs** (`.clinerules/module5-llm-connections.md`)
    *   Explores how the project's text processing skills relate to LLMs, `llms-from-scratch` concepts (advanced tokenization like BPE, data loading, embeddings), modern applications (chatbots, search, sentiment analysis), and further learning paths (NLTK, spaCy, advanced ML/NLP).
