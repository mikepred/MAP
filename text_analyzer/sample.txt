The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. Text processing is fascinating! It helps us understand how computers can make sense of human language. From simple word counting to complex language models, everything starts with basic text manipulation. The future of AI depends on our ability to process and understand text data effectively.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human languages in a manner that is valuable.

Machine learning and deep learning have revolutionized NLP. Modern applications include chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis, and text summarization. The processing pipeline we're building mirrors the initial steps used in these advanced systems.
