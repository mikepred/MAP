# Text Analyzer Project

This project is part of a lesson plan to understand basic text processing in Python, serving as a foundational step towards understanding concepts used in Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Structure

-   `analyzer.py`: The main Python script containing the text analysis logic.
-   `sample.txt`: A sample text file used as input for the analyzer.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Purpose

The script in `analyzer.py` will perform the following actions:
1.  Read content from a text file (`sample.txt`).
2.  Clean the text (e.g., convert to lowercase, remove punctuation).
3.  Tokenize the text into individual words.
4.  Count the frequency of each word.
5.  Display the most common words.

This project aims to illustrate fundamental NLP preprocessing steps.
