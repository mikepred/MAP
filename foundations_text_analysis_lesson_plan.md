# Lesson Plan: Foundations of Text Analysis with `text_analyzer`

**Goal:** This lesson plan aims to provide a solid understanding of fundamental text analysis concepts and practical Python implementation skills using the `text_analyzer` project. It covers text processing, core analysis techniques, and how to interpret and present results.

**Target Audience:** Individuals with a basic understanding of Python, looking to gain foundational knowledge in text analysis. This plan is suitable for beginners in NLP or as a refresher on core text processing tasks.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Proficiency in Python programming.
*   Ability to set up and run Python projects.
*   Basic understanding of software development concepts.

**Learning Approach:**
This lesson plan utilizes the `text_analyzer` project as a practical example. Each module will specify learning objectives and point to relevant sections of the `text_analyzer` comprehension guide (located in the `.clinerules` directory of the project). It is highly recommended to work alongside an AI coding copilot for explanations, experimentation, and debugging.
